Preface 



"It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathe- 
matician to find himself writing about mathematics." So 
the great English mathematician Godfrey Harold 
Hardy, of the University of Cambridge, opened his 1940 
classic A Mathematician !$• Apology. 

Attitudes change. No longer do mathematicians be- 
lieve that they owe the world an apology. And many are 
now convinced that writing about mathematics is at least 
as valuable as writing mathematics, by which Hardy 
meant new mathematics, new research, new theorems. 
In fact, many of us feel that it is pointless for mathe- 
maticians to invent new theorems unless the public gets 
to hear of them. Not the details, of course, but the gen- 
eral nature of the enterprise. In particular, that new 
mathematics is constantly being created, and what it is 
used for. 

The world has changed, too, since Hardy's time. A 
typical day for Hardy consisted in a maximum of four 



IX 



Preface 

hours of intensive thought about research problems; the 
rest of the day was then occupied watching the game of 
cricket, his great nonmathematical passion, and reading 
the newspapers. He must have fitted in some time for 
the occasional research student as well, but he was reti- 
cent about personal matters. A typical day for the mod- 
ern academic is ten or twelve hours long, with teaching 
commitments, research grants to pursue, research to be 
carried out, and liberal doses of pointless bureaucracy to 
get in the way of anything creative. 

Hardy was typical of a certain kind of English aca- 
demic. He set himself high but narrow standards. He 
valued his chosen field for its own internal elegance and 
logic, not for its external uses. He was proud that none 
of his work could have any possible use in warfare, a po- 
sition with which most of us can sympathize, especially 
bearing in mind that his book was published in the open- 
ing years of World War II. 

He would be disappointed in the extreme to be resur- 
rected today and to learn that on the contrary, his 
beloved theory of numbers plays an essential role in the 
mathematical theory of cryptography, with evident mili- 
tary uses. The movie Enigma paints a romanticized view 
of the period when this connection first began to emerge, 
in the vital wartime work of the code breakers at Bletch- 
ley Park. Prominent among them was the tragic figure of 
Alan Turing — pure mathematician, applied mathemati- 
cian, and pioneering computer scientist — who commit- 



Preface 

ted suicide because he was persecuted for being a homo- 
sexual, a sexual orientation that was then illegal and con- 
sidered shameful. Social mores change, too. 

Hardy's classic little gem sheds a great deal of light 
on how academic mathematicians viewed themselves and 
their subject in 1940. It contains important lessons for 
any would-be young mathematician, but some of these 
are obscured by the book's outdated attitudes, such as its 
default assumption that mathematics is strictly a male 
preserve. It is still worth reading, but only if its opinions 
are seen in their historical context, and it is not assumed 
that they all remain valid today. 

Letters to a Young Mathematician is my attempt to 
bring some parts of A Mathematicians Apology up to date, 
namely, those parts that might influence the decisions of 
a young person contemplating a degree in mathematics 
and a possible career in the subject. The letters, ad- 
dressed to "Meg," follow her career in roughly chrono- 
logical order, from high school through to a tenured 
position in a university. They discuss a variety of topics, 
ranging from basic career decisions to the working phi- 
losophy of professional mathematicians and the nature 
of their subject. The intention is not merely to offer 
practical advice, but to give an inside view of the mathe- 
matical enterprise, and to explain what it is really like to 
be a mathematician. 

As a result, many of the issues discussed will also ap- 
peal to a more general audience, the one for which 



XI 



Preface 

Hardy wrote: anyone who is interested in mathematics 
and its relation to human society. What is mathematics? 
What is it good for? How can you learn it? How can you 
teach it? Is it a solitary activity or can it be done in 
groups? How does the mathematical mind work? And 
where is it all going? 

I would never have thought of writing Letters to a 
Young Mathematician were it not for Basic Books, and the 
wonderful mentoring series to which this book belongs. 
The book benefited from the advice of my editor, Bill 
Frucht, who made sure that I confined my ramblings to 
the topic at hand and made them accessible. The main 
intended readership is the "y° un g mathematician" of the 
title, or their parents, relatives, friends . . . but the book 
should appeal to anyone who is interested in what it is 
like to become, and be, a mathematician, even if they 
have no such ambitions themselves.

Why Do Math? 



Dear Meg, 

As you probably anticipated, I was very glad to hear 
you're thinking of studying mathematics, not least be- 
cause it means all those weeks you spent reading and 
rereading A Wrinkle in Time a few summers ago were 
not wasted, nor all the hours I spent explaining tesseracts 
and higher dimensions to you. Rather than deal with 
your questions in the order you asked them, let me take 
the most practical one first: does anyone besides me ac- 
tually make a living doing math? 

The answer is different from what most people 
think. My home university did a survey of its alumni a 
few years back, and they discovered that out of all the 
various degree subjects, the one that led to the highest 
average income was . . . mathematics. Mind you, that 
was before they opened the new medical school, but it 
demolishes one myth: that mathematics can't lead to a 
well-paying job. 



Ian Stewart 

The truth is that we encounter mathematicians 
everywhere, every day, but we hardly ever know it. Past 
students of mine have managed breweries, started their 
own electronics companies, designed automobiles, 
written software for computers, and traded futures on 
the stock market. It simply doesn't occur to us that our 
bank manager might have a degree in math, or that the 
people who invent or manufacture DVDs and MP3 
players employ large numbers of mathematicians, or 
that the technology that transmits those stunning pic- 
tures of the moons of Jupiter relies heavily on math. 
We know that our doctor has a medical degree, and our 
lawyer has a law degree, because those are specific, 
well-defined professions that require equally specific 
training. But you don't find brass plaques on buildings 
advertising a licensed mathematician within, who, for a 
large fee, will solve any math problems that you need 
help with. 

Our society consumes an awful lot of math, but it all 
happens behind the scenes. The reason is straightfor- 
ward: that's where it belongs. When you drive a car, you 
don't want to have to worry about all the complicated 
mechanical things that make it work; you want to get in 
and drive away. Sure, it helps you to be a better driver if 
you're aware of the basics of car mechanics, but even 
that is not essential. It's the same with math. You want 
your car navigation system to give you directions without 
your having to do the math yourself. You want your 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

phone to work without your having to understand signal 
processing and error-correcting codes. 

Some of us, however, need to know how to do the 
math, or none of these wonders could function. It would 
be great if the rest of us were aware of just how strongly 
we rely on mathematics in our daily lives; the problem 
with putting math so far behind the scenes is that many 
people have no idea it's there at all. 

I sometimes think that the best way to change the 
public attitude to math would be to stick a red label on 
everything that uses mathematics. "Math inside." 
There would be a label on every computer, of course, 
and I suppose if we were to take the idea literally, we 
ought to slap one on every math teacher. But we should 
also place a red math sticker on every airline ticket, 
every telephone, every car, every airplane, every traffic 
light, every vegetable . . . 

Vegetable? 

Yes. The days when farmers simply planted what 
their fathers had planted, and their fathers before them, 
are long gone. Virtually any plant you can buy is the out- 
come of a long and complicated commercial breeding 
program. The whole topic of "experimental design," in 
the mathematical sense, was invented in the early 1900s 
to provide a systematic way to assess new breeds of 
plants, not to mention the newer methods of genetic 
modification. 

Wait. Isn't this biology? 



Ian Stewart 



Biology, sure. But math, too. Genetics was one of 
the first parts of biology to go mathematical. The Hu- 
man Genome Project succeeded because of a lot of 
clever work by biologists, but a vital feature of the en- 
tire project was the development of powerful mathe- 
matical methods to analyze the experimental results and 
reconstruct accurate genetic sequences from very frag- 
mentary data. 

So, vegetables get a red sticker. Just about everything 
there is gets a red sticker. 

You go to movies? Do you like the special effects? 
Star Wars, Lord of the Rings? Mathematics. The first 
full-length computer-animated movie, Toy Story, led to 
the publication of about twenty research papers on 
math. "Computer graphics" isn't just computers mak- 
ing pictures; it's the mathematical methods that make 
those pictures look realistic. To do that, you need 
three-dimensional geometry, the mathematics of light, 
"in-betweening" to interpolate a smooth series of im- 
ages between a start and a finish, and lots more. "Inter- 
polation" is a mathematical idea. Computers are clever 
engineering, but they don't do anything useful without 
a lot of clever math. Red sticker. 

And then, of course, there's the Internet. If anything 
makes use of math, it's the Internet. The main search en- 
gine at the moment, Google, was founded on a mathe- 
matical method for working out which web pages are 
most likely to contain the information required by a 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

user. It's based on matrix algebra, probability theory, and 
the combinatorics of networks. 

But the math of the Internet is much more funda- 
mental than that. The telephone network relies on math. 
It's not like the old days when switchboard operators lit- 
erally connected calls by plugging phone lines in by 
hand. Today those lines have to carry millions of mes- 
sages at once. There are so many of us, all wanting to 
talk to our friends or send faxes or access the Internet, 
that we have to share the phone lines and the suboceanic 
cables and the satellite relays, or the network wouldn't 
be able to carry all that traffic. So each conversation is 
broken up into thousands upon thousands of short 
pieces, and only one piece in a hundred is actually trans- 
mitted. At the other end, the missing ninety-nine pieces 
are restored by filling in the gaps as smoothly as possible 
(it works because the samples, though short, are very fre- 
quent, so that the sounds you make when you speak 
change much more slowly than the interval between 
samples). Oh, and the entire signal is coded so that any 
transmission errors can not only be detected, they can be 
put right at the receiving end. 

Modern communications systems simply would not 
work without a huge quantity of math. Coding theory, 
Fourier analysis, signal processing . . . 

Anyway, you go onto the Internet to get a plane 
ticket, book your flight and turn up at the airport, hop 
on the plane, and away you go. The plane flies because 



Ian Stewart 

the engineers who designed it used the mathematics of 
fluid flow, aerodynamics, to make sure it would stay up. 
It navigates using a global positioning system (GPS), a 
system of satellites whose signals, analyzed mathemati- 
cally, can tell you where you are to within a few feet. The 
flights have to be scheduled so that each plane is in the 
right place when it is next needed, rather than some- 
where on the far side of the globe, and that, again, re- 
quires yet other areas of math. 

And so, Meg, my dear, it goes. You asked me whether 
mathematicians are all shut away in universities, or 
whether some of them do work related to real life. Your 
entire life bobs like a small boat on a vast ocean of 
mathematics. 

But hardly anyone notices. Hiding the math away 
makes us all feel comfortable, but it devalues mathemat- 
ics. That is a shame. It makes people think that math 
isn't useful, that it doesn't matter, that it's just intellec- 
tual games without any true significance. Which is why 
I'd like to see those red stickers. In fact, the best reason 
not to use them is that most of the planet would be cov- 
ered with them. 

Your third question was the most important, and the 
saddest. You asked me whether you would have to give 
up your sense of beauty to study mathematics, whether 
everything would become just numbers and equations to 
you, laws and formulas. Rest assured, Meg, I don't blame 
you for asking this, since it's unfortunately a very com- 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

mon idea, but it couldn't be more wrong. It's exactly the 
opposite of the truth. 

What math does for me is this: It makes me aware of 
the world I inhabit in an entirely new way. It opens my 
eyes to nature's laws and patterns. It offers an entirely 
new experience of beauty. 

When I see a rainbow, for instance, I don't just see a 
bright, multicolored arc across the sky. I don't just see 
the effect of raindrops on sunlight, splitting the white 
light from the sun into its constituent colors. I still find 
rainbows beautiful and inspiring, but I appreciate that 
there's more to a rainbow than mere refraction of light. 
The colors are, so to speak, a red (and blue and green) 
herring. What require explanation are the shape and the 
brightness. Why is a rainbow a circular arc? Why is the 
light from the rainbow so bright? 

You may not have thought about those questions. 
You know that a rainbow appears when sunlight is re- 
fracted by tiny droplets of water, with each color of light 
being diverted through a slightly different angle and 
bouncing back from the raindrops to meet the observing 
eye. But if that's all there is to a rainbow, why don't the 
billions of differently colored light rays from billions of 
raindrops just overlap and smear out? 

The answer lies in the geometry of the rainbow. 
When the light bounces around inside a raindrop, the 
spherical shape of the drop causes the light to emerge 
with a very strong focus along a particular direction. 



Ian Stewart 

Each drop in effect emits a bright cone of light, or, 
rather, each color of light forms its own cone, and the 
angle of the cone is slightly different for each color. 
When we look at a rainbow, our eyes detect only the 
cones that come from raindrops lying in particular direc- 
tions, and for each color, those directions form a circle in 
the sky. So we see lots of concentric circles, one for each 
color. 

The rainbow that you see and the rainbow that I see 
are created by different raindrops. Our eyes are in differ- 
ent places, so we detect different cones, produced by dif- 
ferent drops. 

Rainbows are personal. 

Some people think that this kind of understanding 
"spoils" the emotional experience. I think this is rubbish. 
It demonstrates a depressing sort of aesthetic compla- 
cency. People who make such statements often like to 
pretend they are poetic types, wide open to the world's 
wonders, but in fact they suffer from a serious lack of cu- 
riosity: they refuse to believe the world is more wonder- 
ful than their own limited imaginations. Nature is always 
deeper, richer, and more interesting than you thought, 
and mathematics gives you a very powerful way to ap- 
preciate this. The ability to understand is one of the most 
important differences between human beings and other 
animals, and we should value it. Lots of animals emote, 
but as far as we know, only humans think rationally. Fd 
say that my understanding of the geometry of the rain- 



8 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

bow adds a new dimension to its beauty. It doesn't take 
anything away from the emotional experience. 

The rainbow is just one example. I also look at ani- 
mals differently, because I'm aware of the mathematical 
patterns that underlie their movements. When I look at 
a crystal, I am aware of the beauties of its atomic lattice 
as well as the charm of its colors. I see mathematics in 
waves and sand dunes, in the rising and the setting of the 
sun, in raindrops splashing in a puddle, even in birds sit- 
ting on telephone cables. And I'm aware — dimly, as if 
looking out over a foggy ocean — of the infinity of things 
we don't know about these everyday wonders. 

Then there's the inner beauty of mathematics, 
which should not be underrated. Math done "for its 
own sake" can be exquisitely beautiful and elegant. Not 
the "sums" we all do at school; as individuals those are 
mostly ugly and formless, although the general princi- 
ples that govern them have their own kind of beauty. 
It's the ideas, the generalities, the sudden flashes of in- 
sight, the realization that trying to trisect an angle with 
straightedge and compass is like trying to prove that 3 
is an even number, that it makes perfect sense that you 
can't construct a regular seven-sided polygon but you 
can construct one with seventeen sides, that there is no 
way to untie an overhand knot, and why some infinities 
are bigger than others whereas some that ought to be 
bigger are actually equal, that the only square number 
(other than 1 , if you want to be picky) that is the sum 



Ian Stewart 

of consecutive squares, 1 + 4 + 9 + • • • , is the number 
4900. 

You, Meg, have the potential to become an accom- 
plished mathematician. You have a logical mind and also 
an inquiring one. You're not convinced by vague argu- 
ments; you want to see the details and check them out 
for yourself. You don't just want to know how to make 
things work, you want to know why they work. And your 
letter made me hope that you'll come to see mathemat- 
ics as I see it, as something fascinating and beautiful, a 
way of seeing the world that is like no other. 

I hope this sets the scene for you. 

Yours, 
Ian

How I Almost Became a Lawyer 



Dear Meg, 

You ask how I got into mathematics. As with anyone, 
it was a combination of talent (there's no point in being 
modest), encouragement, and the right sort of accident, 
or more accurately, being rescued from the wrong sort 
of accident. 

I was good at math from the start, but when I was 
seven, I very nearly got put off the subject for life. There 
was a math test, and we were supposed to subtract the 
numbers, but I did the same as the previous week and 
added them. So I got a zero and was put in the lower sec- 
tion of the class. Because the other kids in that section 
were hopeless at math, we didn't do anything interest- 
ing. I wasn't being challenged, and I got bored. 

I was saved by two things: a broken bone and my 
mom. 

One of the other kids pushed me over in the play- 
ground as part of a game, and I broke my collarbone. I 



11 



Ian Stewart 

was out of school for five weeks, so Mom decided to make 
good use of the time. She borrowed the arithmetic book 
from the school, and we did some remedial work. Because 
I couldn't write — my right hand was in a sling — I dictated 
the numbers, and she wrote them in the exercise book. 

My mother was rather sensitive about schooling. Her 
own education had been pretty much ruined by the mis- 
taken good intentions of a well-meaning but unimagina- 
tive school inspector. Because she was quick on the 
uptake, she was advanced rapidly through the grades un- 
til, by the age of eight, she was in with a class of ten- 
year-olds. The school inspector came by one day, 
observed the class, and asked the intelligent little girl 
who was answering all the questions, "How old are you, 
my dear?" On being told "eight," he informed the 
school principal that the bright little girl must stay in the 
same class for three years in a row, until the other kids 
her age caught up with her. He wasn't trying to hold her 
back academically; he was worried that she was out of 
her depth socially. But repeating the same lessons three 
years in a row killed off my mother's interest in school; 
all she learned was how to goof off. 

Later she worked out what had happened, but by 
then it was too late. She wanted to be an English teacher, 
but she failed her chemistry exam. In those days, in the 
United Kingdom, failing just one subject, even one that 
was totally irrelevant to the subject you wanted to teach, 
meant that you could not train as a teacher. 



12 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

My mother was determined that nothing similar 
should happen to me. She knew I was clever; she'd 
taught me to read when I was three. After we had done 
400 math problems and I'd gotten 396 of them right, she 
took the exercise book into school, showed it to the head 
teacher, and demanded that I be moved into the top sec- 
tion of the math class. 

When my collarbone healed and I went back to 
school, I was ten weeks ahead of the rest of the class in 
math. We'd overdone it a bit. Fortunately, I didn't suffer 
too much while the class caught up. 

My teacher wasn't a bad teacher. In fact, he was a 
very kind man. But he lacked the imagination to realize 
that he'd put me in the wrong section, and that his mis- 
take was going to damage my education. I'd gotten a 
zero on the test because I was careless, not because I 
didn't understand the material. If he'd simply told me to 
read the questions carefully, I'd have gotten the point. 

I was lucky then, thanks mostly to my mother's 
good sense and willingness to fight for me. But I also 
owe a debt to my schoolmate for putting me in the hos- 
pital. He'd done it quite unintentionally — we were all 
shoving each other around — but it saved my mathe- 
matical bacon. 

After that I had several really brilliant math teachers. 
And those, let me tell you, are rare. There was one 
named W. E. Beck (we nicknamed him "spider") whose 
Friday math test was a long-standing institution. Those 



13 



Ian Stewart 



were not easy tests. They were graded out of twenty 
points, and as the weeks passed, each kid's grades were 
added up. The kids who were good at math were desper- 
ate to come in first for the year; the others were just des- 
perate. I'm not sure it was acceptable educational 
practice — in fact I'm sure it wasn't — but the competitive 
element was good for me and a few buddies. 

One of Beck's rules was that if you missed a test, even 
if you were sick, you got zero. No excuses. So those of us 
who were in the running needed to make every point 
count. We knew we needed a cushion, since you weren't 
safe unless you were ahead by more than twenty points. 
So you absolutely did not lose points by making silly 
mistakes. You read every question, made sure you'd done 
what was asked, checked everything, and then you 
checked it again. 

Later, when I was sixteen, I had a math teacher 
named Gordon Radford. Normally he was lucky to get 
one boy who was really talented at math, but in my class 
there were six of us. So he spent all of his free periods 
teaching us extra math, outside the syllabus. During the 
regular math lessons he told us to sit at the back and do 
our homework; not just math, any homework. And to 
shut up. Those lessons weren't for us; we had to give the 
others a chance. 

Mr. Radford opened my eyes to what math was really 
like: diverse, creative, full of novelty and originality. And 
he did one more crucial thing for me. 



14 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

In those days, there was a public entrance exam 
called a State Scholarship that provided funding to go to 
college. You still needed to be offered a place, but a State 
Scholarship was a big step in the right direction. In the 
last year that State Scholarships were to be offered, I and 
two friends were a year too young to take the exam. Mr. 
Radford had to persuade the headmaster to put us in for 
the exam one year early, something the headmaster 
never did. 

One morning when my two friends and I arrived at 
school, Mr. Radford told us we would be joining the 
class one year ahead of us to take a "mock exam" for the 
State Scholarship in math. A practice run. The older 
kids had done a year's more math and had been practic- 
ing for weeks; we had five minutes' warning. I came in 
first, and my friends were second and third. 

So the headmaster had no choice but to let us take 
the exam for the State Scholarship. After all, he was let- 
ting the older kids take it, and we had proved we were 
better prepared for it than they were. 

All three of us were awarded State Scholarships. 

At that point Mr. Radford got in touch with David 
Epstein, whom he had taught some years before and 
who had become a mathematician at Cambridge Uni- 
versity, along with Oxford, the United Kingdom's lead- 
ing university, especially renowned for its math. 

"What do I do with this boy?" Gordon asked. 

"Send him to us," said David. 



15 



Ian Stewart 

So I went to study math at Cambridge, the home of 
Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgen- 
stein (along with many lesser lights), and I never looked 
back. 

Some careers seem to accumulate people who might 
easily have preferred to do something else. You will run 
into people who tell you that they practice law as a day 
job but they are really novelists or playwrights or jazz 
trombonists. Other people can't settle on something, or 
they see their careers in more purely practical terms, and 
they drift into human resources management or adver- 
tising sales. Which is not to say that these people are not 
dedicated or fulfilled in what they do, but few of them 
consider their work a calling. 

No one drifts into being a mathematician. On the 
contrary, it's a pursuit from which even the talented are 
too easily turned away. If I hadn't broken my collarbone, 
if Mr. Beck hadn't fostered all-out competition among 
his students, if there hadn't been an unusually large 
group of strong students for Mr. Radford to promote —

ing you today I might be telling your parents how to

of all me, would suspect that things could have turned 
out differently. 

In short, Meg, you should not expect your teachers to 
look at you once and simply see, in a brief glance, how 
bright you are. You should not expect them to unerringly

spot your talents and know where they might lead you. 
Some will, and you will be grateful to them for the rest of 
your life. But others, sadly, can't tell, or don't much care, 
or are caught up in their own worries and resentments. 
Then again, the ones who stand in awe of your gifts are 
not the ones from whom you will ultimately learn the 
most. The best teachers will occasionally, perhaps more 
than occasionally, make you feel a bit stupid.

The Breadth of Mathematics 



Dear Meg, 

It's not hard to see, in your question, a sense of — I 
don't know — anticipated boredom, or perhaps some 
worry about what you've let yourself in for. It's all rea- 
sonably interesting now, but, as you say, "Is this all there 
is?" You're reading Shakespeare, Dickens, and T. S. Eliot 
in your English class, and you can reasonably assume 
that while this is of course only a tiny sample of the 
world's great writing, there is not some higher level of 
English literature whose existence has not been dis- 
closed to you. So you naturally wonder, by analogy, 
whether the math you're learning in high school is what 
mathematics is. Does anything happen at higher levels 
besides bigger numbers and harder calculations? 

What you've seen so far is not really the main event. 

Mathematicians do not spend most of their time do- 
ing numerical calculations, even though calculations are 
sometimes essential to making progress. They do not

Letters to a Young Mathematician 

occupy themselves with grinding out symbolic formulas, 
but formulas can nonetheless be indispensable. The 
school math you are learning is mainly some basic tricks 
of the trade, and how to use them in very simple con- 
texts. If we were talking woodwork, it's like learning to 
use a hammer to drive a nail, or a saw to cut wood to 
size. You never see a lathe or an electric drill, you do not 
learn how to build a chair, and you absolutely do not 
learn how to design and build an item of furniture no 
one has thought of before. 

Not that a hammer and saw aren't useful. You can't 
make a chair if you don't know how to cut the wood to 
the correct size. But you should not assume that because 
that's all you ever did at school, it's all carpenters ever do. 

An awful lot of what is now called "mathematics" at 
school is really arithmetic: various notations for num- 
bers, and methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, 
and dividing them. As you get older, you are shown other 
bits of the toolkit: elementary algebra, trigonometry, co- 
ordinate geometry, maybe a little calculus. If your syl- 
labus was "modernized" in the 1960s or 1970s, you may 
get two-by-two matrices and tiny bits of group theory. 
"Modern" is a strange word to use here: it means be- 
tween one and two hundred years old, as opposed to the 
two-hundred-plus-year-old math that formed the bulk 
of the older syllabus. 

Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to progress to the 
more interesting regions of the subject if you don't know 



19 



Ian Stewart 

how to do sums and get them right, how to solve basic 
equations, or what an ellipse is. The highest levels of every 
human activity demand a solid grasp of the basics; think of 
tennis, or playing the violin. Mathematics happens to re- 
quire rather a lot of basic knowledge and technique. 

At university you will encounter a much broader 
conception of mathematics. In addition to the familiar 
numbers, there will be complex numbers, where minus 
one has a square root. Things far more important than 
numbers will appear, such as functions: rules that assign, 
for any chosen number, some specific other number. 
"Square," "cosine," "cube root," those are all functions. 
You won't just solve simultaneous equations in two un- 
knowns; you will understand the solutions of simultane- 
ous equations in any number of unknowns, when they 
exist at all, which they sometimes don't. (Try solving x + 
y = 1, 2x + 2y = 3.) You may learn how the great mathe- 
maticians of the Renaissance solved cubic and quartic 
equations (involving cubes and fourth powers of the un- 
known), not just quadratics; if so, you will probably find 
out why such methods fail for quintic equations (fifth 
powers). You will see why this becomes almost obvious if 
you ignore the numerical values of the equations' solu- 
tions and instead think about their symmetries, and why 
it is arguably more important to understand the symme- 
tries of equations than to be able to solve them. 

You will find out how to formalize the concept of 
symmetry in abstract terms, which is what group theory 



20 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

is. You will discover that Euclid's geometry is not the 
only one possible, and move on to topology, where cir- 
cles and triangles become indistinguishable. You will 
have your intuition challenged by Mobius bands, which 
are surfaces with only one side, and fractals, which are 
shapes so complex that they have a fractional number of 
dimensions. You will learn methods to solve differential 
equations, and eventually you will appreciate that most 
of them cannot be solved by those methods; then you 
will learn how they can still be understood and used, 
even when you cannot write down their solutions. You 
will find out why every number can be resolved uniquely 
into prime factors, be puzzled by the apparent lack of 
patterns in primes despite their statistical regularities, 
and baffled by open questions like the Riemann hypoth- 
esis. You will meet different sizes of infinity, discover the 
real reasons why it is important, and prove that knots 
exist. You will belatedly realize just how abstract your 
subject has become, how far removed from mere num- 
bers, and then numbers will bite you on the ankle, 
reemerging as key ideas. 

You will learn why tops wobble and how that affects 
ice ages; you will comprehend Newton's proof that 
planets' orbits are elliptical, and find out why they aren't 
perfectly elliptical, opening up the Pandora's box of 
chaotic dynamics. Your eyes will be opened to the vast 
range of uses of math, from the statistics of plant breed- 
ing to the orbital dynamics of space probes, from

Google to GPS, from ocean waves to the stability of 
bridges, from the graphics in Lord of the Rings to anten- 
nas for mobile phones. 

You will come to feel just how much of our world 
would be impossible without math. 

And when you survey this glorious diversity, you will 
wonder what makes it all the same thing: why are such 
disparate types of ideas all called mathematics? You will 
have gone from asking "Is this all there is?" to being 
slightly amazed that there can be so much. By then, just 
as you can recognize a chair but can't define one in a 
manner that permits no exceptions, you will find that 
you can recognize mathematics when you see it, but you 
still can't define it. 

Which is as it should be. Definitions pin things 
down, they limit the prospects for creativity and diver- 
sity. A definition, implicitly, attempts to reduce all possi- 
ble variations of a concept to a single pithy phrase. 
Math, like anything still under development, always has 
the potential to surprise. 

Schools — not just yours, Meg, but around the 
world — are so preoccupied with teaching sums that they 
do a poor job of preparing students to answer (or even 
ask) the far more interesting and difficult question of 
what mathematics is. And even though definitions are 
too limiting, we can still try to capture the flavor of our 
subject, using something that the human brain is unusu- 
ally good at: metaphor. Our brains are not like comput- 



22 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

ers, working systematically and logically. They are 
metaphor machines that leap to creative conclusions and 
belatedly shore them up with logical narratives. So, 
when I tell you that one of my favorite "definitions ,, of 
math is Lynn Arthur Steen's phrase "the science of sig- 
nificant form," you may feel that IVe made a useful stab 
at the question, metaphorically speaking. 

What I like about Steen's metaphor is that it captures 
some crucial features. Above all, it is open-ended; it does 
not attempt to specify what kind of form should be con- 
sidered significant, or what "form" or "significant" are 
even supposed to mean. I also like the word "science," 
because math shares far more with the sciences than it 
does with the arts. It has the same reliance on stringent 
testing, except that in science this is done through exper- 
iments, whereas math employs proofs. It has the same 
character of operating within closely specified con- 
straints: you can't just make it up as you go along. Here I 
part company with the postmodernists, who assert that 
everything (except, apparently, postmodernism) is 
merely a social convention. Science, they tell us, consists 
only of opinions that happen to be held by a lot of scien- 
tists. Sometimes this is the case — the prevalent belief 
that the human sperm count is falling is probably an ex- 
ample — but mostly it is not. There is no question that 
science has a social side, but it also has the reality check 
of experiment. Even postmodernists must always enter a 
room through the door, not through the wall.

There is a famous book called What Is Mathematics? 
written by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins. As 
with most books whose titles are questions, the question 
is never quite answered. Yet the authors say some very 
wise things. Their prologue begins, "Mathematics as an 
expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the 
contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic per- 
fection." It goes on to tell us that "All mathematical de- 
velopment has its psychological roots in more or less 
practical requirements. But once started under the pres- 
sure of necessary applications, it inevitably gains mo- 
mentum in itself and transcends the confines of 
immediate utility." And it ends like this: "Fortunately, 
creative minds forget dogmatic philosophical beliefs 
whenever adherence to them would impede constructive 
achievement. For scholars and layman alike it is not phi- 
losophy but active experience in mathematics itself that 
alone can answer the question: What is mathematics? " 
Or, as my friend David Tall often says, "Math is not a 
spectator sport." 

Some mathematicians are more interested in the 
philosophy of their subject than others, and among to- 
day's prominent philosophers of mathematics we find 
Reuben Hersh. He observed that Courant and Robbins 
answered their question "by showing what mathematics 
is, not by telling what it is. After devouring the book 
with wonder and delight, I was still left asking, 'But 
what is mathematics really?'" So Hersh wrote a book 



24 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

with that title, offering what he said was an unconven- 
tional answer. 

Traditionally, there have been two main schools of 
mathematical philosophy: Platonism and formalism. 
Platonists believe that in some (slightly mystical) way, 
mathematical objects exist. They are "out there" in some 
abstract realm. This realm is not imaginary, however, 
because imagination is a human characteristic. It is real, 
in a nonphysical sense. The mathematician's circle, with 
its infinitely thin circumference and a radius that re- 
mains constant to infinitely many decimal places, cannot 
take physical form. If you draw it in sand, as Archimedes 
did, its boundary is too thick and its radius too variable. 
Your drawing is only an approximation of the mathemat- 
ical, Platonic circle. Inscribe it on a platinum slab with a 
diamond-tipped needle — the same difficulties still arise. 

In what sense, then, does a mathematical circle exist} 
And if it doesn't, how can it be useful? Platonists tell us 
that the mathematical circle is an ideal, not realized in 
this world but nevertheless having a reality that is inde- 
pendent of human minds. 

Formalists find such statements fuzzy and meaning- 
less. The first major formalist was David Hilbert, and 
he tried to put the whole of mathematics on a sound 
logical basis by effectively treating it as a meaningless 
game played with symbols. A statement like 2+2=4 
was not, from this point of view, to be interpreted in 
terms of, say, putting two sheep in a pen with two others 



25 



Ian Stewart 

and thus having four sheep. It was the outcome of a 
game played with the symbols 2, 4, +, and =. But the 
game must be played according to an explicit list of ab- 
solutely rigid rules. 

Philosophically, formalism died when Kurt Godel 
proved, to Hilbert's initial fury, that no formal theory 
can capture the whole of arithmetic and be proved logi- 
cally consistent. There will always be mathematical 
statements that remain outside Hilbert's game: neither 
provable nor disprovable. Any such statement can be 
added to the axioms for arithmetic without creating any 
inconsistency. The negation of such a statement has the 
same feature. So we can deem such a statement to be 
true, or we can deem it false, and Hilbert's game can be 
played either way. In particular, the idea that arithmetic 
is so basic and natural that it has to be unique is wrong. 

Most working mathematicians have ignored this, just 
as they have ignored the apparent mysticism of the Pla- 
tonist view, probably because the interesting questions 
in math are those that can either be proved or disproved. 
When you are doing math, it feels as though what you 
are working on is real. You can almost pick things up and 
turn them around, squash them and stroke them and 
pull them to pieces. On the other hand, you often make 
progress by forgetting what it all means and focusing 
solely on how the symbols dance. So the working philos- 
ophy of most mathematicians is a mostly unexamined 
Platonist-Formalist hybrid. 



26 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

That's fine if all you want is to do mathematics. As 
Hersh says, "Mathematics comes first, then philosophiz- 
ing about it, not the other way round." But if, like 
Hersh, you still wonder whether there might be a better 
way to describe that working philosophy, it all comes 
back to that same basic question of what mathematics is. 

Hersh's answer is what he calls the humanist philoso- 
phy. Mathematics is "A human activity, a social phenom- 
enon, part of human culture, historically evolved, and 
intelligible only in a social context." This is a descrip- 
tion, not a definition, since it does not specify the con- 
tent of that activity. The description may sound a bit 
postmodern, but it is made more intelligent than post- 
modernism by Hersh's awareness that the social conven- 
tions that govern the activities of those human minds are 
subject to stringent worasocial constraints, namely, that 
everything must fit together logically. Even if mathe- 
maticians got together and agreed that it equals 3, it 
wouldn't. Nothing would make sense. 

A mathematical circle, then, is something more than 
a shared delusion. It is a concept endowed with ex- 
tremely specific features; it "exists" in the sense that hu- 
man minds can deduce other properties from those 
features, with the crucial caveat that if two minds inves- 
tigate the same question, they cannot, by correct reason- 
ing, come up with contradictory answers. 

That's why it feels as if math is "out there." Finding 
the answer to an open question feels like discovery, not 



27 



Ian Stewart 

invention. Math is a product of human minds but not 
bendable to human will. Exploring it is like exploring a 
new tract of country; you may not know what is around 
the next bend in the river, but you don't get to choose. 
You can only wait and find out. But the mathematical 
countryside does not come into existence until you ex- 
plore it. 

When two members of the Arts Faculty argue, they 
may find it impossible to reach a resolution. When two 
mathematicians argue — and they do, often in a highly 
emotional and aggressive way — suddenly one will stop, 
and say, "I'm sorry, you're quite right, now I see my mis- 
take." And they will go off and have lunch together, the 
best of friends. 

I agree with Hersh, pretty much. If you feel that the 
humanist description of math is a bit woolly, that this 
type of "shared social construct" is a rarity, Hersh offers 
some examples that might change your mind. One is 
money. The entire world runs on money, but what is it? 
It is not pieces of paper or disks of metal; those can be 
printed or minted anew, or handed into a bank and de- 
stroyed. It is not numbers in a computer: if the computer 
blew up, you would still be entitled to your money. 
Money is a shared social construct. It has value because 
we all agree it has value. 

Again, there are strong constraints. If you tell your 
bank manager that your account contains more than his 
computer says it does, he does not respond, "No prob- 



28 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

lem, it's just a social construct, here's an extra ten million 
dollars. Have a nice day." 

It is tempting to think that even if we consider math 
to be a shared social construct, it has a kind of logical in- 
evitability, that any intelligent mind would come up with 
the same math. When the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft 
were sent off into space, they carried coded messages 
from humanity to any alien race that might one day en- 
counter them. Pioneer bore a plaque with a diagram of the 
hydrogen atom, a map of nearby pulsars to show where 
our sun is located, line drawings of a naked man and 
woman standing in front of a sketch of the spacecraft, for 
scale, and a schematic picture of the solar system to show 
which planet we inhabit. The two Voyager craft carried 
records with sounds, music, and scientific images. 

Would an alien recipient be able to decode those 
messages? Would a picture like o-o, two circles joined 
by a line, really look like the hydrogen atom to them? 
What if their version of atomic theory relied on quan- 
tum wave functions instead of primitive "particle" im- 
ages, which even our own physicists tell us are wildly 
inaccurate? Would the aliens understand line drawings, 
given that humans from tribes that have never encoun- 
tered such things fail to do so? Would they consider pul- 
sars significant? 

In most discussions about such questions, one even- 
tually hears it argued that even if they grasped nothing 
else, any intelligent alien would be able to comprehend 



29

simple mathematical patterns, and the rest can be built 
from there. The unstated assumption is that math is 
somehow universal. Aliens would count 1,2,3,... just as 
we do. They would surely see the implied pattern in dia- 
grams like * ** *** **** . 

I'm not convinced. IVe been reading Diamond Dogs, 
by Alistair Reynolds, a novella about an alien construct, 
a bizarre and terrifying tower, through whose rooms you 
progress by solving puzzles. If you get the answer wrong, 
you die, horribly. Reynolds's story is powerful, but there 
is an underlying assumption that aliens would set mathe- 
matical puzzles akin to those that a human would set. In- 
deed, the alien math is too close to human; it includes 
topology and an area of mathematical physics known as 
Kaluza-Klein theory. You are as likely to arrive on the 
fifth planet of Proxima Centauri and find a Wal-Mart. I 
know that narrative constraints demand that the math 
should look like math to the reader, but even so, it doesn't 
work for me. 

I think human math is more closely linked to our 
particular physiology, experiences, and psychological 
preferences than we imagine. It is parochial, not univer- 
sal. Geometry's points and lines may seem the natural 
basis for a theory of shape, but they are also the features 
into which our visual system happens to dissect the 
world. An alien visual system might find light and shade 
primary, or motion and stasis, or frequency of vibration. 
An alien brain might find smell, or embarrassment, but 



30 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

not shape, to be fundamental to its perception of the 
world. And while discrete numbers like 1,2,3, seem uni- 
versal to us, they trace back to our tendency to assemble 
similar things, such as sheep, and consider them prop- 
erty: has one of my sheep been stolen? Arithmetic seems 
to have originated through two things: the timing of the 
seasons and commerce. But what of the blimp creatures 
of distant Poseidon, a hypothetical gas giant like Jupiter, 
whose world is a constant flux of turbulent winds, and 
who have no sense of individual ownership? Before they 
could count up to three, whatever they were counting 
would have blown away on the ammonia breeze. They 
would, however, have a far better understanding than we 
do of the math of turbulent fluid flow. 

I think it is still credible that where blimp math and 
ours made contact, they would be logically consistent 
with each other. They could be distant regions of the 
same landscape. But even that might depend on which 
type of logic you use. 

The belief that there is one mathematics — ours — is a 
Platonist belief. It's possible that "the" ideal forms are 
"out there," but also that "out there" might comprise 
more than one abstract realm, and that ideal forms need 
not be unique. Hersh's humanism becomes Poseidonian 
blimpism: their math would be a social construct shared 
by their society. If they had a society. If they didn't — if 
different blimps did not communicate — could they have 
any conception of mathematics at all? Just as we can't 



31 



Ian Stewart 

imagine a mathematics not founded on the counting 
numbers, we can't imagine an "intelligent" species 
whose members don't communicate with each other. But 
the fact that we can't imagine something is no proof that 
it doesn't exist. 

But I am drifting off the topic. What is mathematics? 
In despair, some have proposed the definition "Mathe- 
matics is what mathematicians do." And what are mathe- 
maticians? "People who do mathematics." This argument 
is almost Platonic in its perfect circularity. But let me ask 
a similar question. What is a businessman? Someone 
who does business? Not quite. It is someone who sees op- 
portunities for doing business when others might miss 
them. 

A mathematician is someone who sees opportunities 
for doing mathematics. 

I'm pretty sure that's right, and it pins down an im- 
portant difference between mathematicians and every- 
one else. What is mathematics? It is the shared social 
construct created by people who are aware of certain op- 
portunities, and we call those people mathematicians. 
The logic is still slightly circular, but mathematicians 
can always recognize a fellow spirit. Find out what that 
fellow spirit does; it will be one more aspect of our 
shared social construct. 

Welcome to the club.

Hasn't It All Been Done? 



Dear Meg, 

In your last letter you asked me about the extent to 
which mathematics at university can go beyond what 
you have already done at school. No one wants to spend 
three or four years going over the same ideas, even if 
they are studied in greater depth. Now, looking ahead, 
you are also right to worry about the scope that exists for 
creating new mathematics. If others have already ex- 
plored such a huge territory, how can you ever find your 
way to the frontier? Is there even any frontier left? 

For once, my task is simple. I can set you at ease on 
both counts. If anything, you should worry about the ex- 
act opposite: that people are creating too much new 
mathematics, and that the scope for new research is so 
gigantic that it will be difficult to decide where to start 
or in which direction to proceed. Math is not a robotic 
way of replacing thought by rigid ritual. It is the most 
creative activity on the planet. 



33 



Ian Stewart 

These statements will be news to many people, possi- 
bly including some of your teachers. It always astonishes 
me that so many people seem to believe that mathemat- 
ics is limited to what they were taught at school, so that 
basically "it's all been done." Even more astonishing is 
the assumption that because "the answers are all in the 
back of the book," there is no scope for creativity, and no 
questions remain unanswered. Why do so many people 
think that their school textbook contains every possible 
question? 

This failure of imagination would amount to de- 
plorable ignorance, were it not for two factors that to- 
gether go a long way to explain it. 

The first is that many students quickly come to dis- 
like mathematics as they pass through the school system. 
They find it rigid, boring, repetitive, and, worst of all, 
difficult. Answers are either right or wrong, and no 
amount of clever verbal jousting with the teacher can 
convert a wrong answer into a correct one. Mathematics 
is a very unforgiving subject. Having developed this neg- 
ative attitude, the last thing the student wants to hear is 
that there is more mathematics, going beyond the al- 
ready daunting contents of the set text. Most people 
want all the answers to be at the back of the book, be- 
cause otherwise they can't look them up. 

Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, one of Britain's most 
distinguished mathematicians and educators, who con- 
tinues to do research at the age of ninety, makes exactly 



34 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

this point in her autobiography To Talk of Many Things. 
(Do read it, Meg; it's inspirational, and very wise.) 
"When I told a teenage friend that I was doing mathe- 
matical research, her reply was, 'Why do that? We have 
enough mathematics to cope with already — we don't 
want any more.'" 

The assumptions behind that statement bear exami- 
nation, but I content myself with just one. Why did 
Kathleen's friend assume that any newly invented math- 
ematics would automatically appear in school texts? 
Again we encounter the same belief, that the math you 
are taught at school is the entire universe of mathemat- 
ics. But no one thinks that about physics, or chemistry, 
or biology, or even French or economics. We all know 
that what we are taught at school is just a tiny part of 
what is currently known. 

I sometimes wish schools would go back to using 
words like "arithmetic" to describe the content of "math" 
courses. Calling them "mathematics" debases the cur- 
rency of mathematical thought; it's a bit like using the 
term "composing" to describe routine exercises in play- 
ing musical scales. However, I lack the power to change 
the name, and if in fact the name were changed, the main 
effect would be to decrease public recognition of mathe- 
matics. For most people, the only time they are aware of 
their life and mathematics intersecting is at school. 

As I wrote in my first letter, this does not imply 
that mathematics has no relevance to our daily lives. 



35 



Ian Stewart 

But the profound influence of our subject on human 
existence takes place behind the scenes and therefore 
passes unnoticed. 

A second reason why few students ever realize that 
there is mathematics outside the textbook is that no one 
ever tells them that. 

I don't blame the teachers. Math is actually very im- 
portant, but because it genuinely is difficult, nearly all of 
the teaching slots are occupied with making sure that 
students learn how to solve certain types of problem and 
get the answers right. There isn't time to tell them about 
the history of the subject, about its connections with our 
culture and society, about the huge quantity of new 
mathematics that is created every year, or about the un- 
solved questions, big and little, that litter the mathemat- 
ical landscape. 

Meg, the World Directory of Mathematicians contains 
fifty-five thousand names and addresses. These people 
don't just sit on their hands. They teach, and most of 
them do research. The journal Mathematical Reviews ap- 
pears twelve times per year, and the 2004 issues totaled 
10,586 pages. But this journal does not consist of re- 
search papers; it consists of brief summaries of research 
papers. Each page summarizes, on average, about five 
papers, so for that year the summaries covered about 
fifty thousand actual papers. The average size of a paper 
is perhaps twenty pages — roughly a million pages of new 
mathematics every year! 



36 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

Kathleen's friend would have been horrified. 

Many teachers are aware of this, but they have a good 
reason not to say much about it. If your students are hav- 
ing problems remembering how to solve quadratic equa- 
tions, the wise teacher will stay well clear of cubic 
equations, which are even more difficult. When the issue 
in class is finding solutions of simultaneous equations 
that possess solutions, it would be demoralizing and con- 
fusing to inform the students that many sets of simulta- 
neous equations have no solutions at all, and others have 
infinitely many. A process of self-censorship sets in. In 
order to avoid damaging the students' confidence, the 
texts do not ask questions that the methods being taught 
cannot answer. So, insidiously, we absorb the lesson that 
every mathematical question has an answer. 

It's not true. 

Our teaching of mathematics revolves around a fun- 
damental conflict. Rightly or wrongly, students are re- 
quired to master a series of mathematical concepts and 
techniques, and anything that might divert them from 
doing so is deemed unnecessary. Putting mathematics 
into its cultural context, explaining what it has done for 
humanity, telling the story of its historical development, 
or pointing out the wealth of unsolved problems or even 
the existence of topics that do not make it into school 
textbooks leaves less time to prepare for the exam. So 
mostly these things aren't discussed. Some teachers — my 
Mr. Radford was an example — find time to fit them in

anyway. Ellen and Robert Kaplan, an American husband- 
and-wife team with a refreshing approach to mathemat- 
ics education, have started a series of "math circles," 
where young children are encouraged to think about 
mathematics in an atmosphere that could not be more 
different from that of a classroom. 

Their success shows that we need to set aside more 
time in the syllabus for such activities. But since math al- 
ready occupies a substantial part of teaching time, 
people who teach other subjects might object. So the 
conflict may well remain unresolved. 

Now let me explain a wonderful thing: the more math- 
ematics you learn, the more opportunities you will find for 
asking new questions. As our knowledge of mathematics 
grows, so do the opportunities for fresh discoveries. This 
may sound unlikely, but it is a natural consequence of how 
new mathematical ideas build on older ones. 

When you study any subject, the rate at which you 
can understand new material tends to accelerate the more 
you already know. You've learned the rules of the game, 
you've gotten good at playing it, so learning the next 
level is easier. At least it would be, except that at higher 
levels you set yourself higher standards. Math is like 
that. To perhaps an extreme degree, it builds new con- 
cepts on top of old ones. If math were a building, it 
would resemble a pyramid erected upside down. Built on 
a narrow base, the structure would tower into the clouds, 
each floor larger than the one below.

The taller the building becomes, the more space 
there is to build more. 

That's perhaps a little too simple a description. 
There would be funny little excrescences protruding all 
over the place, twisting and turning; decorations like 
minarets and domes and gargoyles; stairways and secret 
passageways unexpectedly connecting distant rooms; 
diving boards suspended over dizzying voids. But the in- 
verted pyramid would dominate. 

All subjects are like that to some extent, but their 
pyramids do not widen so rapidly, and new buildings are 
often put up beside existing ones. These subjects resem- 
ble cities, and if you don't like the building you are in, 
you can always move to another one and start afresh. 

Mathematics is all one thing, and moving house is not 
an option. 

Because school math is heavily biased toward num- 
bers, many people think that math comprises only num- 
bers, that mathematical research must consist in 
inventing new numbers. But of course there aren't any, 
are there? If there were, someone would already have in- 
vented them. But this belief is a failure of imagination, 
even when it comes to numbers. 

Most schoolwork on numbers is arithmetical. Add 473 
to 982. Divide 16 by 4. A lot is about notation: fractions 
like 7/5, decimals like 1.4, recurring decimals like 
0.3333. .. , or more obstreperous numbers like it, whose 
decimal digits go on forever without any repetitive pattern. 



39 



Ian Stewart 



How do we know that about it? Not by listing every 
digit, or by listing lots of them and failing to observe any 
repetition. By proving it, indirectly. The first such proof 
was published in 1770 byjohann Lambert, and it is based 
not on geometry but on calculus. It occupies about a page 
and is mostly a calculation. The trick is not the calcula- 
tion but figuring out which calculation to do. 

A few more inventive topics also appear at school 
level, such as prime numbers, which cannot be obtained 
by multiplying two smaller (whole) numbers together. 
But pretty much everything students are exposed to boils 
down to buttons you could push on a pocket calculator. 

The higher floors of the mathematical anti-pyramid 
do not look like this at all. They support concepts, ideas, 
and processes. They address questions very different 
from "add these two numbers," such as, "Why do the 
digits of tt not repeat?" The floors that do deal with 
numbers rapidly get to extremely difficult questions, 
which often appear deceptively straightforward. 

For instance, you will be aware that a triangle with 
sides 3, 4, and 5 units long has a right angle; allegedly 
the ancient Egyptians used a string divided into such 
lengths by knots to survey the building site for the pyra- 
mids. I am skeptical about the practical use of the 3-4—5 
triangle, because string can stretch and I doubt that the 
measurements can be carried out to the required accu- 
racy, but the Egyptians probably knew the triangle's 
properties. Certainly the ancient Babylonians did.

Letters to a Young Mathematician 

Pythagoras 's theorem — one of the few theorems 
mentioned at school that bears the name of its (tradi- 
tional) discoverer — tells us that the squares of the two 
shorter sides add up to the square of the longer one: 3 2 + 
4 2 = 5 2 . There are infinitely many such "Pythagorean tri- 
angles," and ancient Greek mathematicians already knew 
how to find them all. Pierre de Fermat, a seventeenth- 
century French lawyer whose hobby was mathematics, 
asked the kind of imaginative question (not very imagi- 
native; you don't have to go far beyond what is already 
known to encounter yawning gaps in human knowledge) 
that creates new mathematics. We know about sums of 
two squares making squares, but can you do it with 
cubes? Can two cubes add up to a cube? Or two fourth 
powers to a fourth power? Fermat could not discover 
any solutions. He found an elegant proof that it can't be 
done with fourth powers. In his copy of an ancient 
Greek number theory text, he stated that he had a proof 
that it can't be done generally — that there are no solu- 
tions in whole numbers to the equation x n + y n = z n , 
where n is greater than 2 — but "this margin is too small 
to contain it." 

Leave aside the question of the utility of such mathe- 
matics; applications are important too, but right now 
we're talking about creativity and imagination. Take too 
"practically minded" an attitude and you stifle true cre- 
ativity, to everyone's detriment. Fermat's last theorem, as 
the problem came to be known, turned out to be very 



41 



Ian Stewart 

deep and very hard. It is unlikely that Fermat's proof, if 
it existed, was correct. If it was, no one else has ever 
thought of it, not even now, when we know Fermat was 
right. Generations of mathematicians attacked the prob- 
lem and came away with nothing. A few chipped the odd 
corner off it; they proved that it couldn't be done with 
fifth powers, say, or seventh powers. Only in 1994, after 
a hiatus of 350 years, was the theorem proved, by An- 
drew Wiles; his proof was published the following year. 
You probably remember a TV documentary about it. 

Wiles's methods were revolutionary, and much too 
difficult even for a university course at undergraduate or 
introductory graduate level. His proof is very clever and 
very beautiful, incorporating results and ideas from 
dozens of other experts. A breakthrough of the highest 
order. 

The TV program was very moving. Many viewers 
burst into tears. 

The proof of Fermat's last theorem leaps right over 
the undergraduate syllabus. It is too advanced for the 
courses you will take. But you will certainly take more 
elementary courses in number theory, proving theo- 
rems like "every positive integer is a sum of at most 
four squares." You may elect to study algebraic number 
theory, where you will see how the great mathemati- 
cians of past eras chipped pieces off Fermat's last theo- 
rem, and understand how the whole of abstract algebra 
emerged from that process. This is a new world that 



42 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

goes almost totally unnoticed by the great majority of 
humanity. 

Nearly everyone makes use of number theory every 
day, if only because it forms the basis of Internet security 
codes and the data-compression methods employed by 
cable and satellite television. We don't need to be able to 
do number theory to watch TV (otherwise ratings of 
many shows would be way down), but if nobody knew 
any number theory, crooks would be helping themselves 
to our bank accounts, and we'd be stuck with three chan- 
nels. So the general area of math in which Fermat's last 
theorem lives is undoubtedly useful. 

The theorem itself, though, is unlikely to be of much 
use. Very few practical problems rest on adding two big 
powers together to get another such power. (Though I 
am told that at least one problem in physics does depend 
on this.) Wiles's new methods, on the other hand, have 
opened up significant new connections between hitherto 
separate areas of our subject. Those methods will surely 
turn out to be important one day, very likely in funda- 
mental physics, which is today's biggest consumer of 
deep, abstract mathematical concepts and techniques. 

Questions like Fermat's last theorem are not impor- 
tant because we need to know the answer. In the end it 
probably doesn't matter that the theorem was proved 
true rather than false. They are important because our 
efforts to find the answer reveal major gaps in our un- 
derstanding of mathematics. What counts is not the 



43 



Ian Stewart 

answer itself but knowing how to get it. It can only go 
in the back of the book when someone has worked out 
what it is. 

The further we push out the boundaries of mathe- 
matics, the bigger the boundary itself becomes. There 
is no danger that we will ever run out of new problems 
to solve.

Surrounded by Math 



Dear Meg, 

I'm not surprised that you're "both excited and a 
little bit intimidated," as you put it, by your imminent 
move to university. Let me commend your good intu- 
ition on both counts. You'll find the competition 
tougher, the pace faster, the work harder, and the con- 
tent far more interesting. You'll be thrilled by your 
teachers (some of them) and the ideas they lead you to 
discover, and daunted that so many of your classmates 
seem to get there ahead of you. For the first six months 
you'll wonder why the school ever let you in. (After that 
you'll wonder how some of the others were let in.) 

You asked me to tell you something inspirational. 
Nothing technical, just something to hold on to when 
the going gets tough. 

Very well. 

Like many mathematicians, I get my inspiration from 
nature. Nature may not look very mathematical; you 



45 



Ian Stewart 

don't see sums written on the trees. But math is not about 
sums, not really. It's about patterns and why they occur. 
Nature's patterns are both beautiful and inexhaustible. 

I'm in Houston, Texas, on a research visit, and I'm 
surrounded by math. 

Houston is a huge, sprawling city. Flat as a pancake. 
It used to be a swamp, and when there's a heavy thunder- 
storm, it tries to revert to its natural condition. Close by 
the apartment complex where my wife and I always stay 
when we visit, there is a concrete-lined canal that diverts 
a lot of the runoff from the rain. It doesn't always divert 
quite enough; a few years ago the nearby freeway was 
thirty feet under water, and the ground floor of the 
apartment complex was flooded. But it helps. It's called 
Braes Bayou, and there are paths along both sides of it. 
Avril and I like to go for walks along the bayou; the con- 
crete sides are not exactly pretty, but they're prettier 
than the surrounding streets and parking lots, and 
there's quite a lot of wildlife: catfish in the river, egrets 
preying on the fish, lots of birds. 

As I walk along Braes Bayou, surrounded by wildlife, 
I realize that I am also surrounded by math. 

For instance . . . 

Roads cross the bayou at regular intervals, and the 
phone lines cross there too, and birds perch on the 
phone lines. From a distance they look like sheet music, 
fat little blobs on rows of horizontal lines. There seem to 
be special places they like to perch, and it's not at all 



46 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

clear to me why, but one thing stands out. If a lot of 
birds are perching on a wire, they end up evenly spaced. 

That's a mathematical pattern, and I think there's a 
mathematical explanation. I don't think the birds 
"know" they ought to space themselves out evenly. But 
each bird has its own "personal space," and if another 
birds gets too close, it will sidle along the wire to leave a 
bit more room, unless there's another bird crowding it 
from the other side. 

When there are just a few birds, they end up ran- 
domly spaced. But when there are a lot, they get pushed 
close together. As each one sidles along to make itself 
feel more comfortable, the "population pressure" evens 
them out. Birds at the edge of denser regions get pushed 
into less densely populated regions. And since the birds 
are all of the same species (usually they're pigeons), they 
all have much the same idea of what their personal space 
should be. So they space themselves evenly. 

Not exactly evenly, of course. That would be a Pla- 
tonic ideal. As such, it helps us to comprehend a more 
messy reality. 

You could do the math on this problem if you wanted 
to. Write down some simple rules for how birds move 
when the neighbors get too close, plonk them down at 
random, run the rules, and watch the spacing evolve. But 
there's an analogy with a common physical system, 
where that math has already been done, and the analogy 
tells you what to expect. 



47 



Ian Stewart 



It's a bird crystal. 

The same process that makes birds space themselves 
regularly makes the atoms in a solid object line up to 
form a repetitive lattice. The atoms also have a "personal 
space": they repel each other if they're too close to- 
gether. In a solid, the atoms are forced to pack fairly 
tightly, but as they adjust their personal spaces, they 
arrange themselves in an elegant crystal lattice. 

The bird lattice is one-dimensional, since they're sit- 
ting on a wire. A one-dimensional lattice consists of 
equally spaced points. When there are just a few birds, 
arranged at random and not subject to population pres- 
sure, it's not a crystal, it's a gas. 

This isn't just a vague analogy. The same mathemati- 
cal process that creates a regular crystal of salt or calcite 
also creates my "bird crystal." 

And that's not the only math that you can find in 
Braes Bayou. 

A lot of people walk their dogs along the paths. If 
you watch a walking dog, you quickly notice how rhyth- 
mic its movement is. Not when it stops to sniff at a tree 
or another dog, mind you; it's rhythmic only when the 
dog is just bumbling happily along without a thought in 
its head. Tail wagging, tongue lolling, feet hitting the 
ground in a careless doggy dance. 

What do the feet do? 

When the dog is walking, there's a characteristic pat- 
tern. Left rear, left front, right rear, right front. The foot- 



48 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

falls are equally spaced in time, like musical notes, four 
beats to the bar. 

If the dog speeds up, its gait changes to a trot. Now 
diagonal pairs of legs — left rear and right front, then the 
other two — hit the ground together, in an alternating 
pattern of two beats to the bar. If two people walked one 
behind the other, exactly out of step, and you put them 
inside a cow costume, the cow would be trotting. 

The dog is math incarnate. The subject of which it 
is an unwitting example is known as gait analysis; it has 
important applications in medicine: humans often have 
problems moving their legs properly, especially in in- 
fancy or old age, and an analysis of how they move can 
reveal the nature of the problem and maybe help cure 
it. Another application is to robotics: robots with legs 
can move in terrain that doesn't suit robots with 
wheels, such as the inside of a nuclear power station, an 
army firing range, or the surface of Mars. If we can un- 
derstand legged locomotion well enough, we can engi- 
neer reliable robots to decommission old power 
stations, locate unexploded shells and mines, and ex- 
plore distant planets. Right now, we're still using 
wheels for Mars rovers because that design is reliable, 
but the rovers are limited in where they can go. We're 
not decommissioning nuclear power stations at all. But 
the U.S. Army does use legged robots for some tidying- 
up tasks on firing ranges. 

If we learn to reinvent the leg, all that will change.

Egrets standing in the shallows with that characteris- 
tic alert posture, long beaks poised, muscles tensed, are 
hunting catfish. Together they form a miniature ecology, 
a predator-prey system. Ecology's connection with 
mathematics goes all the way back to Leonardo of Pisa, 
also known as Fibonacci, who wrote about a rather 
simple model of the growth of rabbits in 1202, in his 
Liber Abaci. To be fair, the book is really about the 
Hindu- Arabic number system, the forerunner of today's 
ten-symbol notation for numbers, and the rabbit model 
is mainly there as an exercise in arithmetic. Most of the 
other exercises are currency transactions; it was a very 
practical book. 

More-serious ecological models arose in the 1920s, 
when the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra was trying 
to understand a curious effect that had been observed by 
Adriatic fishermen. During World War I, when the 
amount of fishing was reduced, the numbers of food fish 
didn't seem to increase, but the population of sharks and 
rays did. 

Volterra wondered why a reduction in fishing bene- 
fited the predators more than it benefited the prey. To 
find out, he devised a mathematical model, based on 
the sizes of the shark and food-fish populations and 
how each affected the other. He discovered that instead 
of settling down to steady values, populations under- 
went repetitive cycles: large populations became 
smaller but then increased, over and over again. The 



50 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

shark population peaked sometime after the food-fish 
population did. 

You don't need numbers to understand why. With a 
moderate number of sharks, the food fish can reproduce 
faster than they are eaten, so their population soars. This 
provides more food for the sharks, so their population 
also begins to climb; but they reproduce more slowly, so 
there is a delay. As the sharks increase in number, they 
eat more food fish, and eventually there are so many 
sharks that the food-fish population starts to decline. 
Now the food fish cannot support so many sharks, so the 
shark numbers also drop, again with a delay. With the 
shark population reduced, the food fish can once more 
increase . . . and so it goes. 

The math makes this story crystal clear (within the 
assumptions built into the model) and also lets us work 
out how the average population sizes behave over a com- 
plete cycle, something the verbal argument can't handle. 
Volterra's calculations showed that a reduced level of 
fishing decreases the average number of food fish over a 
cycle but increases the average number of sharks. Which 
is just what happened during World War I. 

All of the examples I've told you about so far involve 
"advanced" mathematics. But simple math can also be il- 
luminating. I am reminded of one of the many stories 
mathematicians tell each other after all the nonmathe- 
maticians leave the room. A mathematician at a famous 
university went to look around the new auditorium, and 



51 



Ian Stewart 

when she got there, she found the dean of the faculty 
staring at the ceiling and muttering to himself, "... forty- 
five, forty-six, forty-seven ..." Naturally she interrupted 
the count to find out what it was for. "I'm counting the 
lights," said the dean. The mathematician looked up at 
the perfect rectangular array of lights and said, "That's 
easy, there are . . . twelve that way, and . . . eight that way. 
Twelve eights are ninety-six." "No, no," said the dean 
impatiently. "I want the exact number." 

Even when it comes to something as simple as count- 
ing, we mathematicians see the world differently from 
other folk. 



52 



How Mathematicians Think 



Dear Meg, 

I would say you've lucked out. If you're hearing 
about people like Newton, Leibniz, Fourier, and others, 
it means your freshman calculus teacher has a sense of 
the history of his subject; and your question "How did 
they think of these things?" suggests that he's teaching 
calculus not as a set of divine revelations (which is how 
it's too often done) but as real problems that were solved 
by real people. 

But you're right, too, that the answer "Well, they 
were geniuses" isn't really adequate. Let me see if I can 
dig a little deeper. The general form of your question — 
which is a very important one — is "How do mathemati- 
cians think?" 

You might reasonably conclude from looking at text- 
books that all mathematical thought is symbolic. The 
words are there to separate the symbols and explain 
what they signify; the core of the description is heavily 



53 



Ian Stewart 

symbolic. True, some areas of mathematics make use of 
pictures, but those are either rough guides to intuition 
or visual representations of the results of calculations. 

There is a wonderful book about mathematical cre- 
ation, The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical 
Field, by Jacques Hadamard. It was first published in 
1945, and it's still in print and extremely relevant today. I 
recommend you pick up a copy. Hadamard makes two 
main points. The first is that most mathematical think- 
ing begins with vague visual images and is only later 
formalized with symbols. About ninety percent of math- 
ematicians, he tells us, think that way. The other ten 
percent stick to symbols the entire time. The second is 
that ideas in mathematics seem to arise in three stages. 

First, it is necessary to carry out quite a lot of con- 
scious work on a problem, trying to understand it, ex- 
ploring ways to approach it, working through examples 
in the hope of finding some useful general features. Typ- 
ically, this stage bogs down in a state of hopeless confu- 
sion, as the real difficulty of the problem emerges. 

At this point it helps to stop thinking about the prob- 
lem and do something else: dig in the garden, write lec- 
ture notes, start work on another problem. This gives 
the subconscious mind a chance to mull over the original 
problem and try to sort out the confused mess that your 
conscious efforts have turned it into. If your subcon- 
scious is successful, even if all it manages is to get part 
way, it will "tap you on the shoulder" and alert you to its 



54 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

conclusions. This is the big "aha!" moment, when the 
little lightbulb over your head suddenly switches on. 

Finally, there is another conscious stage of writing 
everything down formally, checking the details, and 
organizing it so that you can publish it and other mathe- 
maticians can read it. The traditions of scientific publica- 
tion (and of textbook writing) require that the "aha!" 
moment be concealed, and the discovery presented as a 
purely rational deduction from known premises. 

Henri Poincare, probably my favorite among the 
great mathematicians, was unusually aware of his own 
thought processes and lectured about them to psycholo- 
gists. He called the first stage "preparation," the second 
"incubation followed by illumination," and the third 
"verification." He laid particular emphasis on the role of 
the subconscious, and it is worth quoting one famous 
section of his essay Mathematical Creation: 

For fifteen days I strove to prove that there could not 
be any functions like those I have since called Fuchsian 
functions. I was then very ignorant; every day I seated 
myself at my table, stayed an hour or two, tried a 
great number of combinations and reached no results. 
One evening, contrary to my custom, I drank black 
coffee and could not sleep. Ideas rose in crowds; I felt 
them collide until pairs interlocked, so to speak, 
making a stable combination. By the next morning I 
had established the existence of a class of Fuchsian 



55 



Ian Stewart 

functions, those which come from the hypergeometric 
series; I had only to write out the results, which took 
but a few hours. 

This was but one of several occasions on which Poin- 
care felt that he was "present at his own unconscious 
work." 

A recent experience of my own also fits Poincare's 
three-stage model, though I did not have the feeling that 
I was observing my own subconscious. A few years ago, I 
was working with my long-term collaborator Marty 
Golubitsky on the dynamics of networks. By "network" I 
mean a set of dynamical systems that are "coupled to- 
gether," with some influencing the behavior of others. 
The systems themselves are the nodes of the network — 
think of them as blobs — and two nodes are joined by an 
arrow if one of them (at the tail end) influences the other 
(at the head end). For example, each node might be a 
nerve cell in some organism, and the arrows might be 
connections along which signals pass from one cell to 
another. 

Marty and I were particularly interested in two as- 
pects of these networks: synchrony and phase relations. 
Two nodes are synchronous if the systems they represent 
do exactly the same thing at the same moment. That 
trotting dog synchronizes diagonally opposite legs: when 
the front left foot hits the ground, so does the back right. 
Phase relations are similar, but with a time lag. The 



56 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

dog's front right foot (which is similarly synchronized 
with its back left foot) hits the ground half a cycle later 
than the front left foot. This is a half-period phase shift. 

We knew that synchrony and phase shifts are com- 
mon in symmetric networks. In fact, we had worked out 
the only plausible symmetric network that could explain 
all of the standard gaits of four-legged animals. And we'd 
sort of assumed, because we couldn't think of any other 
reason, that symmetry was also necessary for synchrony 
and phase shifts to occur. 

Then Marty's postdoc Marcus Pivato invented a very 
curious network that had synchrony and phase shifts but 
no symmetry. It had sixteen nodes, which synchronized 
in clusters of four, and each cluster was separated from 
one of the others by a phase shift of one quarter of a pe- 
riod. The network was almost symmetric at first sight, 
but when you looked closely you could see that the ap- 
parent symmetry was imperfect. 

To us, Marcus's example made absolutely no sense. 
But there was no question that his calculations were cor- 
rect. We could check them, and we did, and they 
worked. But we were left with a nagging feeling that we 
didn't really understand why they worked. They involved 
a kind of coincidence, which definitely happened, but 
"shouldn't have." 

While Marty and Marcus worked on other topics, I 
worried about Marcus's example. I went to Poland for a 
conference and to give some lectures, and for the whole 



57 



Ian Stewart 

of that week I doodled networks on notepads. I doodled 
all the way from Warsaw to Krakow on the train, and 
two days later I doodled all the way back. I felt I was 
close to some kind of breakthrough, but I found it im- 
possible to write down what it might be. 

Tired and fed up, I abandoned the topic, shoved the 
doodles into a filing cabinet, and occupied my time else- 
where. Then one morning I woke up with a strange feel- 
ing that I should dig out the file and take another look at 
the doodles. Within minutes I had noticed that all the 
doodles that did what I wanted had a common feature, 
one that I'd totally missed when I was doodling them. 
Not only that; all of the doodles that didn't do what I 
wanted lacked that feature. At that moment I "knew" 
what the answer to the puzzle was, and I could even write 
it down symbolically. It was neat, tidy, and very simple. 

The trouble with that kind of knowledge, as my biol- 
ogist friend Jack Cohen often says, is that it feels just as 
certain when you're wrong. There is no substitute for 
proof. But now, because I knew what to prove and had a 
fair idea of why it was true, that final stage didn't take 
very long. It was blindingly obvious how to prove that 
the feature that I had observed in my doodles was suffi- 
cient to make happen everything I thought should hap- 
pen. Proving that it was also necessary was trickier, but 
not greatly so. There were several relatively obvious 
lines of attack, and the second or third worked. 

Problem solved. 



58 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

This description fits Poincare's scenario so perfectly 
that I worry that I have embroidered the tale and re- 
arranged it to make it fit. But I'm pretty sure that it re- 
ally did happen the way I've just told you 

What was the key insight? I've just looked through 
my notes from the Warsaw-Krakow train, and they are 
fall of networks whose nodes have been colored. Red, 
blue, green ... At some stage I had decided to color the 
nodes so that synchronous nodes got the same color. Us- 
ing the colors, I could spot hidden regularities in the 
networks, and those regularities were what made Mar- 
cus's example work. The regularities weren't symme- 
tries, not in the technical sense used by mathematicians, 
but they had a similar effect. 

Why had I been coloring the networks? Because the 
colors made it easy to pick out the synchronous clusters. 
I had colored dozens of networks and never noticed 
what the colors were trying to tell me. The answer had 
been staring me in the face. But only when I stopped 
working on the problem did my subconscious have the 
freedom to sort it out. 

It took a week or two to turn this insight into formal 
mathematics. But the visual thinking — the colors — came 
first, and my subconscious had to grapple with the prob- 
lem before I was consciously aware of the answer. Only 
then did I start to reason symbolically. 

There's more to the tale. Once the formal system was 
sorted out, I noticed a deeper idea, which underlay the

whole thing. The similarities between colored cells 
formed a natural algebraic structure. In our previous 
work on symmetric systems we had put a similar struc- 
ture in from the very start, because all mathematicians 
know how to formalize symmetries. The concept con- 
cerned is called a group. But Marcus's network has no 
symmetry, so groups won't help. The natural algebraic 
structure that replaces the symmetry group in my col- 
ored diagrams is something less well known, called a 
"groupoid." 

Pure mathematicians have been studying groupoids 
for years, for their own private reasons. Suddenly I real- 
ized that these esoteric structures are intimately con- 
nected with synchrony and phase shifts in networks of 
dynamical systems. It's one of the best examples, among 
the topics that I've been involved with, of the mysterious 
process that turns pure math into applications. 

Once you understand a problem, many aspects of it 
suddenly become much simpler. As mathematicians the 
world over say, everything is either impossible or trivial. 
We immediately found lots of simpler examples than Mar- 
cus's. The simplest has just two nodes and two arrows. 

Research is an ongoing activity, and I think we have 
to go further than Hadamard and Poincare to under- 
stand the process of invention, or discovery, in math. 
Their three-stage description applies to a single "inven- 
tive step" or "advance in understanding." Solving most 
research problems involves a whole series of such steps. 



60 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

In fact, any step may break down into a series of sub- 
steps, and those substeps may also break down in a simi- 
lar manner. So instead of a single three-stage process, we 
get a complicated network of such processes. Hadamard 
and Poincare described a basic tactic of mathematical 
thought, but research is more like a strategic battle. The 
mathematician's strategy employs that tactic over and 
over again, on different levels and in different ways. 

How do you learn to become a strategist? You take a 
leaf from the generals' book. Study the tactics and 
strategies of the great practitioners of the past and pres- 
ent. Observe, analyze, learn, and internalize. And one 
day, Meg — closer than you might think — other mathe- 
maticians will be learning from you.

How to Learn Math 



Dear Meg, 

By now, youVe surely noticed that the quality of 
teaching in a college setting varies widely. This is be- 
cause, for the most part, your professors and their 
teaching assistants are not hired, kept on, or promoted 
based on their ability to teach. They are there to do re- 
search, whereas teaching, while necessary and impor- 
tant for any number of reasons, is decidedly secondary 
for many of them. Many of your professors will be 
thrilling lecturers and devoted mentors; others, you'll 
find, will be considerably less thrilling and devoted. 
You'll have to find a way to succeed even with teachers 
whose greatest talents are not necessarily on display in 
the classroom. 

I once had a lecturer who, I was convinced, had dis- 
covered a way to make time stand still. My classmates 
disagreed with this thesis but felt that his sleep-inducing 
powers must surely have military uses. 



62 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

The vast amounts that have been written about 
teaching math might give the impression that all of the 
difficulties encountered by math students are caused by 
teachers, and it is always the teacher's responsibility to 
sort out the student's problems. This is, of course, one 
of the things teachers are paid to do, but there is some 
onus on the student as well. You need to understand 
how to learn. 

Like all teaching, math instruction is rather artificial. 
The world is complicated and messy, with lots of loose 
ends, and the teacher's job is to impose order on the con- 
fusion, to convert a chaotic set of episodes into a coher- 
ent narrative. So your learning will be divided into 
specific modules, or courses, and each course will have a 
carefully specified syllabus and a text. In some settings, 
such as some American public schools, the syllabus will 
specify exactly which pages of the text, and which prob- 
lems, are to be tackled on a given day. In other countries 
and at more advanced levels, the lecturer has more of a 
free hand to pick his or her own path through the mate- 
rial, and the lecture notes take the place of a textbook. 

Because the lectures progress through set topics, one 
step at a time, it is easy for students to think that this is 
how to learn the material. It is not a bad idea to work 
systematically through the book, but there are other tac- 
tics you can use if you get stuck. 

Many students believe that if you get stuck, you 
should stop. Go back, read the offending passage again;

repeat until light dawns — either in your mind or outside 
the library window. 

This is almost always fatal. I always tell my students 
that the first thing to do is read on. Remember that you 
encountered a difficulty, don't try to pretend that all is 
sweetness and light, but continue. Often the next sen- 
tence, or the next paragraph, will resolve your problem. 

Here is an example, from my book The Foundations of 
Mathematics, written with David Tall. On page 16, in- 
troducing the topic of real numbers, we remark that 
"the Greeks discovered that there exist lines whose 
lengths, in theory, cannot be measured exactly by a ra- 
tional number." 

One might easily grind to a halt here — what does 
"measured by" mean? It hasn't been defined yet, and — 
oh help — it's not in the index. And how did the Greeks 
discover this fact anyway? Am I supposed to know it 
from a previous course? From this course? Did I miss a 
lecture? The previous pages of the book offer no assis- 
tance, however many times you reread them. You could 
spend hours getting nowhere. 

So don't. Read on. The next few sentences explain 
how Pythagoras 's theorem leads to a line whose length is 
the square root of two, and state that there is no rational 
number mln such that (m/n) 2 = 2. This is then proved, 
cleverly using the fact that every whole number can be 
expressed as a product of primes in only one way. The 
result is summarized as "no rational number can have 



64 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

square 2, and hence that the hypotenuse of the given tri- 
angle does not have rational length." 

By now, everything has probably slotted into place. 
"Measured by" presumably means "has a length equal 
to." The Greek reasoning alluded to in such an offhand 
manner is no doubt the argument using Pythagoras 's 
theorem; it helps to know that Pythagoras was Greek. 
And you should be able to spot that "the square root of 
two is not rational" is equivalent to "no rational number 
can have square 2." 

Mystery solved. 

If you are still stuck after plowing valiantly ahead in 
search of enlightenment, now is the time to go to your 
class tutor or the lecturer and ask for assistance. By try- 
ing to sort the problem out for yourself, you will have set 
your mind in action, and thus you are much more likely 
to understand the teacher's explanation. It's much like 
Poincare's "incubation" stage of research. Which, with 
fair weather and a following wind, leads to illumination. 

There is another possibility, but it's one where help 
from the teacher is probably essential. Even so, you can 
try to prepare the ground. Whenever you get stuck on a 
piece of mathematics, it usually happens because you do 
not properly understand some other piece of mathemat- 
ics, which is being used without explicit mention on the 
assumption that you can handle it easily. Remember the 
upside-down pyramid of mathematical knowledge? You 
may have forgotten what a rational number is, or what 



65 



Ian Stewart 

Pythagoras proved, or how square roots relate to 
squares. Or you may be wondering why the uniqueness 
property of prime factorization is relevant. If so, you 
don't need help to understand the proof that the square 
root of two is irrational; you need help rehearsing ra- 
tional numbers, prime factors, or basic geometry. 

It takes a certain insight into your own thought 
processes as well as a certain discipline to pinpoint ex- 
actly what you don't understand and relate it to your im- 
mediate difficulty. Your tutors know about such things 
and will be on the lookout for them. It is, however, a 
very useful trick to master for yourself, if you can. 

To sum up: If you think you are stuck, begin by 
plowing ahead regardless, in the hope of gaining en- 
lightenment, but remember where you got stuck, in 
case this doesn't work. If it doesn't, return to the stick- 
ing point and backtrack until you reach something you 
are confident you understand. Then try moving ahead 
again. 

This process is very similar to a general method for 
solving a maze, which computer scientists call "depth- 
first search." If possible, move deeper into the maze. If 
you get stuck, backtrack to the first point where there is 
an alternative path, and follow that. Never go over the 
exact same path twice. This algorithm will get you 
safely through any maze. Its learning analogue does not 
come with such a strong guarantee, but it's still a very 
good tactic. 



66 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

As a student I took this method to extremes. My 
usual method for reading a mathematics text was to 
thumb through it until I spotted something interesting, 
then work backward until I had tracked down every- 
thing I needed to read the interesting bit. I don't really 
recommend this to everyone, but it does show that 
there are alternatives to starting at page 1 and continu- 
ing in sequence until you get to page 250. 

Let me urge upon you another useful trick. It may 
sound like a huge amount of extra work, but I assure you 
it will pay dividends. 

Read around your subject. 

Do not read only the assigned text. Books are ex- 
pensive, but universities have libraries. Find some 
books on the same topic or similar topics. Read them, 
but in a fairly casual way. Skip anything that looks too 
hard or too boring. Concentrate on whatever catches 
your attention. It's amazing how often you will read 
something that turns out to be helpful next week, or 
next year. 

The summer before I went off to Cambridge to study 
math, I read dozens of books in this easygoing way. One 
of them, I remember, was about "vectors," which the au- 
thor defined as "quantities that have both magnitude and 
direction." At the time this made very little sense to me, 
but I liked the elegant formulas and simple diagrams with 
lots of arrows, and I skimmed through it more than 
once. I then forgot it. In the opening lecture on vectors, 



67 



Ian Stewart 

suddenly it all clicked into place. I understood exactly 
what the author had been trying to tell me, before the lec- 
turer got that far. All those formulas seemed obvious: I 
knew why they were true. 

I can only assume that my subconscious had been 
stirred up, just as Poincare claimed, and during the in- 
tervening period, it had created some order out of my 
desultory wanderings through that book on vectors. It 
was just waiting for a few simple clues before it could 
form a coherent picture. 

When I say "read around your subject," I don't mean 
just the technical material. Read Eric Temple Bell's Men 
of Mathematics, still a cracking read even if some of the 
stories are invented and women are almost invisible. 
Sample the great works of the past; James Newman's The 
World of Mathematics is a four- volume set of fascinating 
writings about math from ancient Egypt through to rela- 
tivity. There has been a spate of popular math books in 
recent years, on the Riemann hypothesis, the four color 
theorem, it, infinity, mathematical crackpots, how the 
human brain thinks mathematical thoughts, fuzzy logic, 
Fibonacci numbers. There are even books on the appli- 
cations of mathematics, such as D'Arcy Thompson's 
classic On Growth and Form, about mathematical pat- 
terns in living creatures. It may be outmoded in biologi- 
cal terms — it was written long before the structure of 
DNA was found — but its overall message remains as 
valid as ever. 



68 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

Such books will broaden your appreciation of what 
math is, what it can be used for, and how its sits in hu- 
man culture. There will likely be no questions about any 
of these topics on your exams. But awareness of these is- 
sues will make you a better mathematician, able to grasp 
the essentials of any new topic more confidently. 

There are also some specific techniques that will im- 
prove your learning skills. The great American mathe- 
matical educator George Polya put a lot of them into his 
classic How to Solve It. He took the view that the only 
way to understand math properly is the hands-on 
method: tackling problems and solving them. He was 
right. But you can't learn this way if you get stuck on 
every problem you try. So your teachers will set you a 
carefully chosen sequence of problems, starting with 
routine calculations and leading up to more challenging 
questions. 

Polya offers many tricks for boosting your problem- 
solving abilities. He describes them far better than I can, 
but here is a sample. If the problem seems baffling, try to 
recast it in a simpler form. Look for a good example and 
try your ideas out on the example; later, you can general- 
ize to the original setting. For instance, if the problem is 
about prime numbers, try it on 7, 13, or 47. Try working 
backward from the conclusion: what steps must we take 
to get there? Try several examples and look for common 
patterns; if you find one, try to prove that it must always 
happen.

As you remarked in your letter, Meg, one of the main 
differences between high school and college is that in 
college the students are treated much more like adults. 
This means that to a much greater extent, it's sink or 
swim: pass, fail, or find another major. There is plenty of 
help available for the asking, but that too takes more ini- 
tiative than it did in high school. No one is likely to take 
you by the hand and say, "It looks like you're having 
trouble." 

On the other hand, the rewards for self-sufficiency 
are much greater. Your high school was mainly grateful 
if you were not a problem requiring some sort of extra 
attention, and unless you were extremely lucky, the most 
it could offer an exceptional student (beyond the grades 
certifying him or her to move on) was an extracurricular 
club and perhaps an award or two. In a university you 
will encounter real scholars who are on the lookout for 
young people capable of doing real mathematics, and 
they are just waiting for you to stand out, if you can.

Fear of Proofs 



Dear Meg, 

You're quite correct: One of the biggest differences 
between school math and university math is proof. At 
school we learn how to solve equations or find the area of 
a triangle; at university we learn why those methods 
work, and prove that they do. Mathematicians are ob- 
sessed with the idea of "proof." And, yes, it does put a lot 
of people off. I call them proofophobes. Mathemati- 
cians, in contrast, are proofophiles: no matter how much 
circumstantial evidence there may be in favor of some 
mathematical statement, the true mathematician is not 
satisfied until the statement is proved. In full logical rigor, 
with everything made precise and unambiguous. 

There's a good reason for this. A proof provides a 
cast-iron guarantee that some idea is correct. No 
amount of experimental evidence can substitute for that. 

Let's take a look at a proof and see how it differs from 
other forms of evidence. I don't want to use anything 



71 



Ian Stewart 

that involves technical math, because that will obscure 
the underlying ideas. My favorite nontechnical proof is 
the SHIP-DOCK theorem, which is about those word 
games in which you have to change one word into an- 
other by a sequence of moves: CAT, COT, COG, DOG. 
At each step, you are allowed to change (but not move) 
exactly one letter, and the result must be a valid word (as 
determined by, say, Webster's). 

Solving this word puzzle isn't particularly hard: for 
instance, 

SHIP 

SHOP 

SHOT 

SLOT 

SOOT 

LOOT 

LOOK 

LOCK 

DOCK 

There are plenty of other solutions. But I'm not after 
a solution as such, or even several: I'm interested in 
something that applies to every solution. Namely, at 
some stage, there must be a word that contains two vow- 
els. Like SOOT (and LOOT and LOOK) in this partic- 
ular answer. Here I mean exactly two vowels, no more 
and no less. 



72 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

To avoid objections, let me make it clear what 
"vowel" means here. One thorny problem is the letter Y. 
In YARD the letter Y is a consonant, but in WILY it is a 
vowel. Similarly, the W in CWMS acts as a vowel: 
"cwm" is Welsh, and refers to a geological formation for 
which there seems to be no English word, although 
"corrie" (Scottish) and "cirque" (French) are alterna- 
tives. We need to be very careful about letters that some- 
times act as vowels but on other occasions are 
consonants. In fact, the safest way to avoid the kinds of 
words that all Scrabble players love is to throw away 
Webster's and redefine "vowel" and "word" in a more 
limited sense. For the purposes of this discussion, a 
"vowel" will mean one of the letters A, E, I, O, U, and a 
"word" will be required to contain at least one of those 
five letters. Alternatively, we can require Y and W always 
to count as vowels, even when they are being used as 
consonants. What we can't do, in this context, is allow 
letters to be sometimes vowels, sometimes consonants. 
I'll come back to that later. 

It's not a question of what the correct convention is 
in linguistics; I'm setting up a temporary convention for 
a specific mathematical purpose. Sometimes in math the 
best way to make progress is to introduce simplifica- 
tions, and that's what I'm doing here. The simplifica- 
tions are not assertions about the outside world: they are 
ways to restrict the domain of discourse, to keep it man- 
ageable. A more complicated analysis could probably 



73 



Ian Stewart 

handle the exceptional letters like Y too, but that would 
complicate the story too much for my present purpose. 

With that caveat, am I right? Is it true that every so- 
lution of the SHIP-DOCK puzzle includes a word (in 
the new, restricted sense) with exactly two vowels (in the 
new, restricted sense)? 

One way to investigate this is to look for other solu- 
tions, such as 

SHIP 

CHIP 

CHOP 

COOP 

COOT 

ROOT 

ROOK 

ROCK 

DOCK 

Here we find two vowels in COOP, COOT, ROOT, 
and ROOK. But even if a lot of individual solutions have 
two vowels somewhere, that doesn't prove that they all 
have to. A proof is a logical argument that leaves no 
room for doubt. 

After a certain amount of experiment and thought, 
the "theorem" that I am proposing here starts to seem 
obvious. The more you think about how vowels can 
change their positions, the more obvious it becomes that 



74 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

somewhere along the way there must be exactly two 
vowels. But a feeling that something is "obvious" does 
not constitute a proof, and there's some subtlety in the 
theorem because some four-letter words contain three 
vowels, for instance, OOZE. 

Yes, but ... on the way to a three-vowel word, we 
surely have to pass through a two-vowel word? I agree, 
but that's not a proof either, though it may help us find 
one. Why must we pass through a two-vowel word? 

A good way to find a proof here is to pay more atten- 
tion to details. Keep your eye on where the vowels go. 
Initially, there is one vowel in the third position. At the 
end, we want one vowel in the second position. But — a 
simple but crucial insight — a vowel cannot change posi- 
tion in one step, because that would involve changing 
two letters. Let's pin that particular thought down, logi- 
cally, so that we can rely on it. Here's one way to prove 
it. At some stage, a consonant in the second position has 
to change to a vowel, leaving all the other letters un- 
changed; at some other stage, the vowel in the third po- 
sition has to change to a consonant. Maybe other vowels 
and consonants wander in and out, too, but whatever 
else happens, we can now be certain that a vowel cannot 
change position in one step. 

How does the number of vowels in the word change? 
Well, it can stay the same; it can increase by 1 (when a 
consonant changes to a vowel), or it can decrease by 1 
(when a vowel changes to a consonant). There are no 



75 



Ian Stewart 

other possibilities. The number of vowels starts at 1 with 
SHIP and ends at 1 with DOCK, but it can't be 1 at 
every step, because then the unique vowel would have to 
stay in the same place, position three, and we know that 
it has to end up in position two. 

Idea: think about the earliest step at which the num- 
ber of vowels changes. The number of vowels must have 
been 1 at all times before that step. Therefore it changes 
from 1 to something else. The only possibilities are 
and 2, because the number either increases or decreases 
byl. 

Could it be 0? No, because that means the word 
would have no vowels at all, and by definition no "word" 
in our restricted sense can be like that. Therefore the 
word contains two vowels; end of proof. We've barely 
started analyzing the problem, and a proof has popped 
out of its own accord. This often happens when you fol- 
low the line of least resistance. Mind you, things really 
start to get interesting when the line of least resistance 
leads precisely nowhere. 

It's always a good idea to check a proof on examples, 
because that way you often spot logical mistakes. Let's 
count the vowels, then: 

SHIP 1 vowel 

SHOP 1 vowel 

SHOT 1 vowel 

SLOT 1 vowel 



76 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

SOOT 2 vowels 

LOOT 2 vowels 

LOOK 2 vowels 

LOCK 1 vowel 

DOCK 1 vowel 

The proof says to find the first word where this num- 
ber is not 1, and that's the word SOOT, which has two 
vowels. So the proof checks out in this example. More- 
over, the number of vowels does indeed change by at 
most 1 at each step. Those facts alone do not mean that 
the proof is correct, however; to be sure of its correct- 
ness you have to check the chain of logic and make sure 
that each link is unbroken. I'll leave you to convince 
yourself that this is the case. 

Notice the difference here between intuition and 
proof. Intuition tells us that the single vowel in SHIP 
can't hop around to a different position unless a new 
vowel appears somewhere. But this intuition doesn't 
constitute a proof. The proof emerges only when we try 
to pin the intuition down: yes, the number of vowels 
changes, but when} What must the change look like? 

Not only do we become certain that two vowels must 
appear, we understand why this is inevitable. And we get 
additional information free of charge. 

If a letter can sometimes be a vowel and sometimes a 
consonant, then this particular proof breaks down. For 
instance, with three-letter words there is a sequence: 



77 



Ian Stewart 

SPA 
SPY 
SAY 
SAD 

If we count Y as a vowel in SPY but as a consonant in 
SAY (which is defensible but also debatable), then each 
word has a single vowel, but the vowel position moves. I 
don't think this effect can cause trouble when changing 
SHIP into DOCK, but that depends on a much closer 
analysis of the actual words in the dictionary. The real 
world can be messy. 

Word puzzles are fun (try changing ORDER into 
CHAOS). This particular puzzle also teaches us some- 
thing about proofs and logic. And about the idealizations 
that are often involved when we use math to model the 
real world. 

There are two big issues about proof. The one that 
mathematicians worry about is, what is a proof? The rest 
of the world has a different concern: why do we need 
them? 

Let me take those questions in reverse order: one 
now, and the other in a later letter. 

Fve begun to observe that when people ask why 
something is necessary, it is usually because they feel un- 
comfortable doing it and are hoping to be let off the 
hook. A student who knows how to construct proofs 
never asks what they're for. In fact, a student who knows 



78 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

how to do long multiplication in his head while doing a 
handstand also never asks why that's worth doing. 
People who enjoy performing an activity hardly ever feel 
the need to question its worth; the enjoyment alone is 
enough. So the student who asks why we need proofs is 
probably having trouble understanding them, or con- 
structing his own. He is hoping you will answer, 
"There's no need to worry about proofs. They're totally 
useless. In fact, I've taken them off the syllabus and they 
won't come up in the test." 

Ah, in your dreams. 

It's still a good question, and if I leave it at what I've 
just said, I'm ducking the issue just as blatantly as any 
proofophobic student. 

Mathematicians need proofs to keep them honest. 
All technical areas of human activity need reality checks. 
It is not enough to believe that something works, that it 
is a good way to proceed, or even that it is true. We need 
to know why it's true. Otherwise, we don't know any- 
thing at all. 

Engineers test their ideas by building them and see- 
ing whether they hold up or fall apart. Increasingly they 
do this in simulation rather than by building a bridge 
and hoping it won't fall down, and in so doing they refer 
their problems back to physics and mathematics, which 
are the sources of the rules employed in their calculations 
and the algorithms that implement those rules. Even so, 
unexpected problems can turn up. The Millennium

Bridge, a footbridge across the Thames in London, 
looked fine in the computer models. When it opened 
and people started to use it, it suddenly started to sway 
alarmingly from side to side. It was still safe, it wasn't 
going to fall down, but crossing it wasn't an enjoyable 
experience. At that point it became clear that the simula- 
tions had modeled people as smoothly moving masses; 
they had ignored the vibrations induced by feet hitting 
the deck. 

The military learned long ago that when soldiers 
cross a bridge, they should fall out of step. The synchro- 
nized impact of several hundred right feet can set up vi- 
brations and do serious damage. I suspect this fact was 
known to the Romans. No one expected a similar kind of 
synchronization to arise when individuals walked across 
the bridge at random. But people on a bridge respond to 
the movement of the bridge, and they do so in a similar 
way and at roughly the same time. So when the bridge 
moved slightly — perhaps in response to a gust of wind — 
the people on it started to move in synchrony. The more 
closely the footsteps of the people became synchronized, 
the more the bridge moved, which in turn increased the 
synchronization of the footsteps. Soon the whole bridge 
was swaying from side to side. 

Physicists use mathematics to study what they amus- 
ingly call the real world. It is real, in a sense, but much of 
physics addresses rather artificial aspects of reality, such 
as a lone electron or a solar system with only one planet. 



80 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

Physicists are often scathing about proofs, partly out of 
fear, but also because experiment gives them a very ef- 
fective way to check their assumptions and calculations. 
If an intuitively plausible idea leads to results that agree 
with experiment, there's not much point in holding the 
entire subject up for ten, fifty, or three hundred years 
until someone finds a rigorous proof. I agree entirely. 
For example, there are calculations in quantum field the- 
ory that have no rigorous logical justification, but agree 
with experiment to an accuracy of nine decimal places. It 
would be silly to suggest that this agreement is an acci- 
dent, and that no physical principle is involved. 

The mathematicians' take on this, though, goes fur- 
ther. Given such impressive agreement, it is equally silly 
not to try to find out the deep logic that justifies the cal- 
culation. Such understanding should advance physics di- 
rectly, but if not, it will surely advance mathematics. And 
mathematics often impinges indirectly on physics, prob- 
ably a different branch of physics, but if so, it's a bonus. 

So that's why proofs are necessary, Meg. Even for 
people who would prefer not to be bothered with them.

¦ Can't Computers 
Solve Everything? 



Dear Meg, 

Yes, computers can calculate much faster than hu- 
mans, and much more accurately, which I gather has led 
some of your friends to question the value of your stud- 
ies. There is a point of view that this makes mathemati- 
cians obsolete. I can reassure you that we're not. 

Anyone who thinks computers can supplant mathe- 
maticians understands neither computing nor mathe- 
matics. It's like thinking we don't need biologists now 
that we have microscopes. Possibly the underlying mis- 
conception is that math is just arithmetic, and since 
computers can do arithmetic faster and more accurately 
than humans, why do we need the humans? The answer, 
of course, is that math is not just arithmetic. 

Microscopes made biology more interesting, not less, 
by opening up new ways to approach the subject. It's the 
same with computers and mathematics. One very inter-

esting and important thing computers have done for the 
mathematician is to make it possible to carry out experi- 
ments quickly and rapidly. These experiments test con- 
jectures, occasionally reveal that what we were hoping to 
prove is wrong, and — with increasing frequency — per- 
form gigantic calculations that allow us to prove theo- 
rems that would otherwise be out of reach. Sometimes 
the people who think math consists of big sums are 
right. 

Take, for example, the Goldbach conjecture. In 1742 
Christian Goldbach, an amateur mathematician, wrote 
to Leonhard Euler that as far as he could verify, every 
even number is a sum of two primes. For instance, 8 = 3 
+ 5, 10 = 5 + 5, 100 = 3 + 97. Calculating by hand, Gold- 
bach could test his conjecture on just a small list of num- 
bers. On a modern computer you can quickly test 
billions of numbers: the current record is 2 x 10 17 . 
Every time anyone has carried out such a test, they have 
found that Goldbach was right. However, no proof of his 
conjecture (which would turn it into a theorem) has yet 
been found. 

Why worry? If a billion experiments agree with 
Goldbach, surely what he said must be true? 

The problem is that mathematicians use theorems to 
prove other theorems. A single false statement in princi- 
ple ruins the whole of mathematics. (In practice, we 
would notice the falsehood, isolate the offending state- 
ment, and avoid using it.) For example, the number it is

rather annoying, and it would be nice to get rid of it. We 
might decide that there's no real harm in replacing tt 
with 3 (as some say the Bible does, but only if you take 
an obscure passage extremely literally) or by 22/7. And if 
all you want to use tt for is to calculate perimeters of cir- 
cles and the like, a good enough approximation will do 
no harm. 

However, if you really think that tt is equal to 3, the 
repercussions are much greater. A simple line of reason- 
ing reveals an unintended consequence. If tt = 3, then tt 
-3=0, and dividing both sides by tt — 3 (which, thanks 
to Archimedes, we know is nonzero, so division is per- 
mitted), we get 1=0. Multiplying by any number we 
wish, we prove that all numbers are zero; it follows that 
any two numbers are the same. So when you go into your 
bank to draw $100 from your account, the teller can give 
you $1 and insist that this makes no difference; and in 
fact it doesn't, because you can then walk into Neiman 
Marcus or a Rolls-Royce dealership and explain that 
your $1 equals a million. More interestingly, murderers 
should not be jailed, because killing one person is the 
same as killing none; on the other hand, someone who 
has never touched drugs in their life should be impris- 
oned, since possession of no cocaine is the same as pos- 
sessing a million tons of it. And so on . . . 

Mathematical facts fit together and lead, via logic, to 
new facts. A deduction is only as strong as its weakest 
link. To be safe, all weak links must be removed. It

would therefore be dangerous to verify Goldbach's con- 
jecture on a computer for numbers up to, say, twenty 
digits, and conclude that it must be true. 

Surely, you think, Ian's being a bit pedantic. If a 
statement is true for such big numbers, it has to be true 
for any numbers, no? 

No. It doesn't work like that. For a start, twenty dig- 
its, in the mathematical universe, is tiny. The great 
ocean of numbers stretches to infinity, and even a num- 
ber with a billion digits is, in some contexts, small. A 
classic example occurs in prime number theory. Al- 
though there is no evident pattern to the sequence of 
primes, there are statistical regularities. Sometime be- 
fore 1849, when he wrote a letter about the discovery, 
Carl Friedrich Gauss found a good approximate formula 
relating the number of primes less than some specified 
number to the "logarithmic integral" of that number. It 
was soon noticed that the approximation always seems to 
be slightly larger than the correct value. Again, com- 
puter experiments verified that property for billions of 
numbers. 

But the generalization is false. In 1914, John Little- 
wood proved that the correct value and the logarithmic 
integral approximation swap places infinitely often. But 
no one knew of a specific number for which the approxima- 
tion was smaller than the correct value, until Littlewood 's 
student Samuel Skewes proved, in 1933, that such a num- 
ber must have at most 10 10000000000000000000000000000000000 



85 



Ian Stewart 

digits. That's thirty-four zeros in the exponent. Moreover, 
his proof involved an assumption, a notorious unproved 
statement known as the Riemann hypothesis. In 1955 
Skewes proved that if you do not assume the Riemann hy- 
pothesis, then those thirty- four zeros in the exponent 
must be increased to one thousand zeros. And this gigan- 
tic number, please recall, is not the one we seek: it is the 
number of digits that number possesses. 

Skewes's number has since been reduced to 1.4 x 
10 316 , which is tiny by comparison. 

With numbers this large, the kind of experiment we 
can perform on a computer is totally irrelevant. And in 
number theory, that size is rather typical. 

It wouldn't matter if all we were trying to do was ap- 
proximate primes in terms of logarithmic integrals. But 
mathematics deduces new facts from old ones. And as we 
saw with it, if the old fact is actually wrong, consequent 
deductions can destroy the entire basis of mathematics. 
No matter how extensive the evidence of computer cal- 
culations may be, we still have to use the grey matter be- 
tween our ears. Computers can be valuable assistants, 
but only when a lot of human thought has gone into set- 
ting up the computations. We have not yet been made 
obsolete by our own creations.

Mathematical Storytelling 



Dear Meg, 

In my last letter I told you why proofs are necessary. 
Now I turn to the other question I raised: what is a 
proof? 

The earliest recorded proofs, along with the notion 
that proofs are necessary, occur in Euclid. His Elements, 
written around 300 BC, laid out much of Greek geome- 
try in a logical sequence. It begins with two types of fun- 
damental assumptions, which Euclid calls axioms and 
common notions. Both are basically a list of assumptions 
that will be made. For instance, axiom 4 states that "all 
right angles are equal," and common notion 2 states that 
"if equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal." The 
main difference is that the axioms are about geometric 
things and the common notions are about equality. The 
modern approach lumps them all together as axioms. 

These assumptions are stated in order to provide a 
logical starting point. No attempt is made to prove 



87 



Ian Stewart 

them; they are the "rules of the game" for Euclidean 
geometry. You are free to disagree with the assumptions 
or invent new ones, if you wish; but if you do, you are 
playing a different game with different rules. All Euclid 
is trying to do is make the rules of his game explicit, so 
that the players know where they stand. 

This is the axiomatic method, which remains in use 
today. Later mathematicians observed gaps in Euclid's 
logic, unstated assumptions that should really be in- 
cluded as axioms. For example, any line passing through 
the center of a circle must meet its circumference if the 
line is extended sufficiently far. Some tried to prove Eu- 
clid's most complex axiom, that parallel lines neither con- 
verge nor diverge from the others. Eventually, Euclid's 
good taste was demonstrated when it was realized that all 
such attempts are bound to fail. To muddy the philosoph- 
ical waters, over the centuries, various deep difficulties in 
the axiomatic approach have appeared, such as Godel's 
discovery that if mathematics is logically consistent, then 
we can never prove it to be so. We can live with Godelian 
uncertainties if we have to, and we do have to. 

Textbooks of mathematical logic base their descrip- 
tions of "proof" on Euclid's model. A proof, they tell us, 
is a finite sequence of logical deductions that begins with 
either axioms or previously proved results and leads to a 
conclusion, known as a theorem. Provided each step 
obeys the rules of logical inference — which can be found 



88 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

in textbooks on elementary logic — then the theorem is 
proved. 

If you dispute the axioms, you are also free to dispute 
the theorem. If you prefer alternative rules of inference, 
you are free to invent your own. The claim is only that 
with those rules of inference, acceptance of the stated 
axioms implies acceptance of the theorem. If you want to 
make it equal to 3, you have to accept that all numbers 
are equal. If you want different numbers to be different, 
you have to accept that tt is not 3. What you can't do is 
pick and mix, having tt equal to 3 but zero different 
from one. It's as simple and sensible as that. 

This definition of "proof is all very well, but it is 
rather like defining a symphony as "a sequence of notes 
of varying pitch and duration, beginning with the first 
note and ending with the last." Something is missing. 
Moreover, hardly anybody ever writes a proof the way 
the logic books describe. In 1999 I was musing on this 
discrepancy, having accepted an invitation to a confer- 
ence in Abisko, Sweden, on "Stories of Science and the 
Science of Stories." Abisko is north of the Arctic Circle, 
in Lapland, and a group of about thirty science fiction 
writers, popular science writers, journalists, and histori- 
ans of science were going to spend a week there seeking 
common ground. Wondering what I was going to say to 
them, I suddenly realized what a proof really is. 

A proof is a story. 



89 



Ian Stewart 



It is a story told by mathematicians to mathemati- 
cians, expressed in their common language. It has a be- 
ginning (the hypotheses) and an end (the conclusion), 
and it falls apart instantly if there are any logical gaps. 
Anything routine or obvious can safely be omitted, be- 
cause the audience knows about such things and wants 
the narrator to get on with the main story line. If you 
were reading a spy novel and the hero was dangling 
above a chasm on the end of a burning rope hanging 
from a helicopter, you would not want to read ten pages 
on the force of gravity and the physiological effects of a 
high-velocity impact. You'd want to find out how he 
saves himself. It is the same with proofs. "Don't waste 
time solving the quadratic, I know how to do that. But 
tell me, why do its solutions determine the stability of 
the limit cycle?" 

In my paper (reprinted in Mission to Abisko) I said 
this: "If a proof is a story, then a memorable proof must 
tell a ripping yarn. What does that tell us about how to 
construct proofs? Not that we need a formal language in 
which every tiny detail can be checked algorithmically, 
but that the story line should come out clearly and 
strongly. It isn't the syntax of the proof that needs im- 
provement: it's the semantics." That is, the essence of a 
proof is not its "grammar" but its meaning. 

In that paper, I contrasted this admittedly vague and 
woolly notion with a much more formal one, the idea of 
a "structured proof," advocated by the computer scien- 



90 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

tist Leslie Lamport. Structured proofs make explicit 
every step in the logic, be it deep or trivial, clever or ob- 
vious. Lamport makes a strong case in favor of struc- 
tured proofs as a teaching aid, and there's no doubt that 
they can be very effective in making sure that students 
really do understand details. Part of that case is an anec- 
dote: a famous result called the Schroder-Bernstein the- 
orem. Georg Cantor had found a way to count how 
many members a set has, even when that set is infinite, 
using a generalized type of number that he called a 
"transfinite number." The Schroder-Bernstein theorem 
tells us that if two transfinite numbers are less than or 
equal to each other, then they must actually be equal. 
Lamport was teaching a course based on the classic text 
General Topology by John Kelley, which includes a proof 
of the theorem, but when the extra details needed for the 
students were added, Kelley's proof turned out to be 
wrong. 

Years later, Lamport could no longer locate the error. 
The proof seemed obviously correct. But five minutes 
spent writing down a structured proof revealed the mis- 
take again. 

I was worried, because I'd put a proof of the 
Schroder-Bernstein theorem into one of my own texts. I 
looked up Kelley's proof for myself but could not dis- 
cover a mistake. So I e-mailed Lamport, who suggested 
that I write down a structured proof. Instead, I worked 
my way very systematically through Kelley's argument,

Ian Stewart 



in effect creating a structured proof in an informal way, 
and eventually I spotted the error. 

There is a classic proof of the Schroder-Bernstein 
theorem that starts with two sets, corresponding to the 
two transfmite cardinals. Each set is split into three 
pieces, using a notion of "ancestor" invented purely for 
this particular proof, and the pieces are matched. In ef- 
fect, this proof tells a story about the two sets and their 
component pieces. It's not the most gripping of stories, 
but it has a clear plot and a memorable punch line. For- 
tunately, I had used the classic proof in my textbook, and 
not Kelley's reworking of it. Because Kelley had told the 
wrong story. Attempting, I suspect, to simplify the clas- 
sic version, he had overdone things and violated Ein- 
stein's dictum: "as simple as possible, but not more so." 

The presence of this mistake supports Lamport's 
view about the value of structured proofs. But, to quote 
my paper, "There's another interpretation, not contra- 
dictory but complementary, which is that Kelley told a 
good story badly. It's rather as if he'd introduced the Three 
Musketeers as Pooh, Piglet, and Eeyore. Some parts of 
the story would [still] have made sense — their insepara- 
ble companionship, for instance — but others, such as the 
incessant swordplay, would not. ..." 

If we think of a proof in the textbook sense, all proofs 
are on the same footing, just as all pieces of music look 
like tadpoles sitting on a wire fence when expressed in 
musical notation, unless you are an expert and can

"hear" sheet music in your head. But when we think of a 
proof as a story, there are good stories and bad ones, 
gripping tales and boring ones, like stirring or insipid 
music. There is an aesthetic of proof, so that a really 
good story can be a thing of beauty. 

Paul Erdos had an unorthodox line on the beauty of 
proofs. Erdos was an eccentric and brilliant mathemati- 
cian who collaborated with more people than anyone 
else on the planet; you can read his life story in Paul 
Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers. Anybody 
who coauthored a paper with him is said to have an 
"Erdos number" of one. Their collaborators have Erdos 
number two, and so on. It's the mathematician's version 
of the Oracle of Kevin Bacon, in which actors are linked 
to Bacon by their appearances in the same movies, or by 
their appearances with actors who've appeared with Ba- 
con, and so on. My Erdos number is three. I never col- 
laborated with Erdos, and I'm not on the list of people 
with Erdos number two, but one of my collaborators is. 

Anyway, Erdos reckoned that in Heaven, God had a 
book that contained all the best proofs. If Erdos was re- 
ally impressed by a proof, he declared it to be from "The 
Book." In his view, the mathematician's job was to sneak 
a look over God's shoulder and pass on the beauty of His 
creation to the rest of His creatures. 

Erdos's deity's Book is a book of stories. I ended my 
Abisko talk like this: "Psychologists now tell us that 
without emotional underpinnings, the rational part of 



93 



Ian Stewart 

our mind doesn't work. It seems that we can only be ra- 
tional about things if we have an emotional commitment 
to such a recently evolved technique as rationality ... I 
don't think I could get very emotional about a structured 
proof, however elegant. But when I can really feel the 
power of a mathematical story line, something happens 
in my mind that I can never forget ... I'd rather we im- 
proved the storytelling of proofs, instead of dissecting 
them into bits that can be placed in stacks of file cards 
and sorted into order."

Going for the Jugular 



Dear Meg, 

If you want to make a real name for yourself as a 
mountaineer, you have to conquer a peak that no one 
else has climbed. If you want to make a real name for 
yourself as a mathematician, there is no better way than 
to vanquish one of the subject's long-standing unsolved 
problems. The Poincare conjecture, the Riemann hy- 
pothesis, the Goldbach conjecture, the twin primes 
conjecture. 

I don't advise being that ambitious when you are 
working for a PhD! Big problems, like big mountains, are 
dangerous. You could spend three or four years doing ex- 
tremely clever things, but fail to achieve your goal and 
end up with nothing. Math differs from the other sci- 
ences in this regard: if you carry out a series of chemistry 
experiments, you can always write up the results whether 
or not they confirm your thesis adviser's theories. But in 
math, you normally can't write a thesis saying, "Here's 



95 



Ian Stewart 

how I tried to solve the problem, and here's why it 
didn't work." 

Even professionals have to treat big problems with 
considerable respect. Universities nowadays expect their 
faculty to be productive, and they tend to measure pro- 
ductivity in terms of publications per year. If you publish 
nothing for five years and then solve the Poincare con- 
jecture, you'll be set for life, assuming you are allowed to 
keep your job while you are doing it. If you publish 
nothing for five years and then fail to solve the Poincare 
conjecture, you'll be out on your ear. 

The sensible compromise is to spend some of your 
time working on a big problem and the rest working 
smaller, solvable, but still worthwhile problems. It would 
be wonderful to live in a world where it was possible to 
focus solely on the big issues, but we don't. Neverthe- 
less, a few brave souls have managed to find a way to do 
just that, and succeed. In their hands, the time-honored 
conjecture acquires a proof, and becomes a theorem. 

In my last letter I told you that a proof is a story. It is 
often said that there are basically only seven plots for a 
novel, and the ancient Greeks knew them all. There 
seem to be relatively few narrative lines for mathemati- 
cal proofs, too, but the ancient Greeks knew only one: 
the short, sweet, compellingly clever argument of Eu- 
clid's that made QED a household word. 

What, then, are we to make of mathematical proofs 
that are hundreds or even thousands of pages long? Or 



96 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

proofs that involve months of calculation on a big net- 
work of computers? More and more of these daunting 
beasts are coming into existence, usually as solutions to 
one of those big, open problems. Instead of the short, 
compelling story line known to the Greeks, these proofs 
are epics, or worse, long cycles of stories whose main 
thread may be submerged in intricate subplots for chap- 
ters at a time. What happened to Erdos's vision of the 
beauty of God's mathematical creation? Are these mam- 
moth proofs really necessary? Are they so vast only be- 
cause mathematicians are too stupid to find the short, 
elegant versions written in The Book? 

Wiles's landmark proof of Fermat's last theorem 
amounted to about one hundred pages of highly techni- 
cal mathematics, prompting the science journalist John 
Horgan to write a provocative article titled "The Death 
of Proof." Horgan assembled a variety of reasons why 
proofs were becoming obsolete, including the rise of the 
computer, the disappearance of proofs from school 
math, and the existence of blockbusters like Wiles's. It 
was an interesting attempt to wrench defeat from the 
jaws of victory, to treat a historic achievement as bad 
news. Yes, we put a man on the moon, but look at all the 
valuable rocket fuel we had to use up. 

Wiles's proof may be a blockbuster, but it tells a rip- 
ping yarn. He had to use massive mathematical machin- 
ery for so simple a question, much as a physicist needs a 
particle accelerator many miles in circumference to 



97 



Ian Stewart 

study a quark. But far from being sloppy and unwieldy, 
his proof is rich and beautiful. Those hundred pages 
have a plot, a story line. An expert can skim through the 
details and follow the narrative, with its twists and turns 
of logic, and its strong element of suspense: will the hero 
overcome the last theorem in the final pages, or will the 
ghost of Fermat continue to taunt the mathematical pro- 
fession? No one declared literature dead because War 
and Peace was rather long or because Finnegans Wake was 
not being read in schools. Professional mathematicians 
can handle a hundred pages of proof. Even ten thousand 
pages — the total length of the classification theorem for 
finite simple groups, combining the work of dozens of 
people over a decade or more — does not daunt them. 

There is no reason to expect every short, simple, and 
true statement to have a short, simple proof. In fact, 
there is good reason to expect the opposite. Godel also 
proved that in principle, some short statements some- 
times require long proofs. But we can never know, in ad- 
vance, which short statements these are. 

Pierre de Fermat was born in 1601. His father sold 
leather; his mother was the daughter of a family of par- 
liamentary lawyers. In 1648 he became a king's councilor 
in the local parliament of Toulouse, where he served for 
the rest of his life, dying in 1665, just two days after con- 
cluding a legal case. He never held an academic position 
of any kind, but mathematics was his passion. The math- 
ematical historian Bell called him "the Prince of ama- 



98 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

teurs," but most of today's professionals would be happy 
with half his ability. Though he worked in many fields of 
mathematics, Fermat's most influential ideas were in 
number theory, a subject that grew out of the work of 
Diophantus of Alexandria, who flourished around AD 
250 and wrote a book called Arithmetica. It was about 
what are now called Diophantine equations, equations 
that must be solved in whole numbers. 

One problem to which Diophantus gave a com- 
pletely general answer is that of finding "Pythagorean 
triangles": two perfect squares whose sum is also a per- 
fect square. Pythagoras's theorem tells us that such 
triples are the lengths of sides of a right triangle. Ex- 
amples are 3 2 + 4 2 = 5 2 and 5 2 + 12 2 = 13 2 . Fermat 
owned a copy of Arithmetica, which inspired many of 
his investigations, and he used to write down his con- 
clusions in the margin. Sometime around 1637 he must 
have been thinking about the Pythagorean equation, 
and he asked himself what happens if instead of squares 
you try cubes or higher powers, for instance, x 4 +y* = z 4 . 
But he couldn't find any examples. In the margin of his 
copy of Arithmetica he made the most famous note in 
the history of mathematics: "To resolve a cube into the 
sum of two cubes, a fourth power into two fourth pow- 
ers, or in general any power higher than the second 
into two of the same kind, is impossible; of which fact I 
have found a remarkable proof. The margin is too 
small to contain it." 



99 



Ian Stewart 

This statement has come to be known as his "last 
theorem," because for many years it was the only asser- 
tion of his that his successors had neither proved nor dis- 
proved. Nobody could reconstruct Fermat's "remarkable 
proof," and it seemed increasingly doubtful that he had 
really found one. But if he had possessed a proof, even 
though it couldn't fit in a margin, it would surely be con- 
cise and elegant enough to earn a place in God's Book? 
No one was writing blockbuster proofs in the seven- 
teenth century. Yet for three and a half centuries, mathe- 
matician after mathematician failed to find Fermat's 
missing proof. Then, in the late 1980s, Wiles began an 
extended attack on the problem. He worked alone in the 
attic of his house, telling only a few select colleagues 
who were sworn to secrecy. 

Wiles 's strategy, like that of many mathematicians 
before him, was to assume that a solution existed and 
then play with the numbers algebraically in the hope 
that this would lead to a contradiction. His starting 
point was an idea emanating from the German mathe- 
matician Gerhard Frey, who realized that you could 
construct a type of cubic equation known as an elliptic 
curve from the three numbers occurring in the pur- 
ported solution of Fermat's "impossible" equation. This 
was a brilliant idea, because mathematicians had been 
playing around with elliptic curves for more than a cen- 
tury and had developed plenty of ways of manipulating 



100 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

them. What's more, mathematicians then realized that 
the elliptic curve made from Fermat's roots would have 
such strange properties that it would contradict another 
conjecture — the so-called Taniyama-Shimura-Weil 
conjecture — that governs the behavior of such curves. 

No one had ever proved the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil 
conjecture, though most mathematicians thought it was 
probably right. If it were right, of course, the roots of Fer- 
mat's equation would lead to a contradiction, showing 
that they could not exist. So Wiles took a deep breath and 
set about trying to prove the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil 
conjecture. For seven years, he brought every big gun of 
number theory to bear on it, until he eventually came up 
with a strategy that cracked it wide open. Although he 
worked alone, he didn't invent the whole area by himself. 
He kept in close touch with all new developments on el- 
liptic curves, and without a strong community of number 
theorists creating a steady stream of new techniques, he 
probably would not have succeeded. Even so, his contri- 
bution is massive, and it is propelling the subject into ex- 
citing new territory. 

Wiles's proof has now been published in full, and in 
print it comes to a bit over one hundred pages. Certainly 
too long to fit into a margin. Was it worth it? 

Absolutely. 

The machinery that Wiles developed to crack Fer- 
mat's last theorem is opening up entire new areas of 



101 



Ian Stewart 

number theory. Agreed, the story he had to tell was 
lengthy, and only experts in the area could hope to un- 
derstand it in any detail, but it makes no more sense to 
complain about that than it would to complain that in 
order to read Tolstoy in the original, you have to be able 
to understand Russian.

Blockbusters 



Dear Meg, 

No, I was not joking when I said that the classifica- 
tion of the finite simple groups runs to ten thousand 
pages. It is currently being simplified and reorganized, 
though. With luck and a following wind, it might shrink 
to only two thousand. Most of the proof was carried out 
by hand, and the ideas behind it were entirely the prod- 
uct of the human mind. But some key parts required 
computer assistance. 

This is a growing trend, and it has led to a new kind 
of narrative style for proofs, the computer-assisted proof, 
which has come into existence only in the last thirty years 
or so. This is like the fast-food outlet that serves billions 
of dull, repetitive burgers: It does the job, but not pret- 
tily. There are often some clever ideas, but their role is to 
reduce the problem to a massive — but in principle rou- 
tine — calculation. This is then entrusted to a computer, 
and if the computer says "yes," the proof is complete. 



103 



Ian Stewart 

An example of this kind of proof turned up recently 
in relation to the Kepler problem. In 1611 Johannes 
Kepler was considering how spheres can be packed to- 
gether. He came to the conclusion that the most efficient 
method — the one that packs as many balls as possible 
into a given region — is the one that greengrocers often 
use to stack oranges. Make a flat layer in a honeycomb 
pattern, then stack another such layer on top, with the 
oranges sitting in the depressions of the first layer, and 
continue like this forever. This pattern shows up in lots 
of crystals, and physicists call it the face-centered cubic 
lattice. 

It is often said that Kepler's statement is "obvious/' 
but anyone who thinks so does not appreciate the sub- 
tleties. For example, it is not even clear that the most ef- 
ficient arrangement includes a flat plane of spheres. 
Greengrocers start stacking on a flat surface, but you 
don't have to. Even the two-dimensional version of the 
problem — showing that a honeycomb pattern is the 
most efficient way to pack equal circles in the plane — 
wasn't proved until 1947, when Laszlo Fejes Toth finally 
did it. His proof is too complicated to belong in The 
Book, but it's all we have. 

In 1998, Thomas Hales announced a computer- 
assisted proof of the Kepler conjecture that involved 
hundreds of pages of mathematics plus three gigabytes 
of supporting computer calculations. It has since been 
published in the Annals of Mathematics, the world's pre- 



104 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

mier math journal, with one important reservation: the 
referees state that they have not been able to check every 
single step in the computations. 

Hales's approach was to write down a list of all the 
possible ways to arrange suitable small clusters of 
spheres; then prove that whenever the cluster is not what 
you find in the face-centered cubic lattice, it can be 
"compressed" by rearranging the spheres. Conclusion: 
the only incompressible arrangement — the one that fills 
space most efficiently — is the conjectured one. This is 
how Toth handled the two-dimensional case, and he 
needed to list about fifty possibilities. Hales had to deal 
with thousands, in three dimensions, and the computer 
had to verify an enormous list of inequalities — those 
three gigabytes of memory are what's needed to tabulate 
them all. 

One of the earliest proofs to use this brute-force 
computer method was the proof of the four color theo- 
rem. About a century ago Francis Guthrie asked whether 
every possible two-dimensional map containing any 
arrangement of countries can be colored using only four 
colors, so that neighboring countries always get different 
colors. It sounds simple, but the proof was highly elu- 
sive. Eventually, in 1976, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang 
Haken proved the four color theorem. By trial and error 
and hand calculations, they first came up with a list of 
nearly two thousand configurations of "countries" and in- 
voked the computer to prove that the list is "unavoidable," 



105

meaning that every possible map must contain countries 
arranged in the same way as at least one configuration in 
the list. 

The next step was to show that each of these configu- 
rations is "reducible." That is, each configuration can be 
shrunk down until a part of it disappears, leaving a sim- 
pler map. Crucially, the shrinking must ensure that if the 
simpler map left behind can be colored with four colors, 
the original one can be as well. Now remember that 
every possible map must contain at least one of the two 
thousand configurations. So even the simpler map that 
you have just created by this process must have another 
configuration that can be shrunk again and so on. The 
upshot is that if you can find a way to shrink every possi- 
ble configuration, you have your proof. Matching every 
configuration with a way to "shrink" it like this involved 
a huge but routine computer calculation, which in those 
days took about two thousand hours on the fastest avail- 
able computer. (Nowadays it takes maybe an hour.) But 
in the end, Appel and Haken had their answer. 

Computer-assisted proofs raise issues of taste, cre- 
ativity, technique, and philosophy. Some philosophers 
feel that with their brute-force methods, they are not 
proofs in the traditional sense. Yet this kind of massive 
but routine exercise is what computers were invented to 
do. It's what they're good at, and it's what humans are 
very poor at. If a computer and a human being both 
carry out a huge calculation and get different answers, 



106 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

the smart money is on the computer. But it must be said 
that any one bit of the proof, any one calculation by the 
computer, is usually trivial and extremely dull. It's only 
when you string them together that they're worth any- 
thing. If Wiles's proof of Fermat's last theorem is rich in 
ideas and form — like War and Peace — the computer 
proofs are more like telephone directories. In fact, for 
the Appel-Haken proof, and even more so Hales 's proof, 
life is — literally — too short to read the whole thing in 
fall detail, let alone check it. 

Still, these proofs are not devoid of elegance and in- 
sight. You have to be pretty clever about how you set up 
the problem for the computer to tackle. What's more, 
once you know the conjecture is right, you can set about 
trying to find a more elegant way to prove it. This might 
sound strange, but it's well known among mathemati- 
cians that it's much easier to prove something you al- 
ready know is true. In mathematical common rooms 
worldwide, you will occasionally hear someone suggest — 
only partly as a joke — that it might be a good idea to 
spread rumors that some important problem has been 
solved, in the hope that this might speed up its actual so- 
lution. It's a bit like crossing the Atlantic. For Christo- 
pher Columbus this was desperately hard, but it was 
easier for John Cabot, sailing just five years later, be- 
cause he knew what Columbus had found. 

Does this mean that eventually mathematicians may 
find God's proofs for Kepler and the four color theorem? 



107 



Ian Stewart 



Maybe, but maybe not. It's a bit naive to imagine that 
every theorem that is simple to state must therefore have 
a simple proof. We all know that many tremendously dif- 
ficult problems are deceptively easy to state: "land on the 
moon," "cure cancer." Why should math be different? 

Experts often get rather passionate about proofs, ei- 
ther that the best-known one can't be simplified, or that 
alternative methods that someone is proposing can't 
possibly work. Often they're right, but sometimes their 
judgment can be affected by knowing too much. If 
you're an experienced mountain climber proposing to 
scale a high peak, with glaciers and crevasses and the 
like, the "obvious" path may be exceedingly long and 
complicated. 

It's natural, too, to assume that the sheer cliff face, 
which seems to be the only alternative route, is simply 
unclimbable. But it may be possible to invent a helicop- 
ter that can swing you quickly and easily up to the top. 
The experts can see the crevasses and the cliff, but they 
may miss a good idea for the design of a helicopter. Oc- 
casionally someone invents such a piece of machinery 
out of the blue, and proves all the experts wrong. 

On the other hand, think of Godel. We know that 
some proofs simply have to be long, and perhaps the four 
color theorem and Fermat's last theorem are examples. 
For the four color theorem, it is possible to do some 
back-of-the-envelope calculations that show that if you 
want to use the current approach — finding a list of "un- 



108 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

avoidable" configurations and then eliminating them 
one at a time by some "shrinking" process — then noth- 
ing radically shorter is possible. But that, in effect, is just 
counting the likely crevasses. It doesn't rule out a heli- 
copter. So if these massive tomes are the best we can do, 
why did Fermat write what he did? Surely he can't have 
stumbled across a hundred-page proof, including within 
it a proof of a conjecture about elliptic curves that hadn't 
even been proposed yet, and scribbled down that it 
didn't quite fit into the margin. 

A leading algebraic number theorist, Sir Peter 
Swinnerton-Dyer, has offered a simpler explanation of 
Fermat's claim: "I am sure that Fermat believed he had 
proved it; and indeed one can with fair confidence re- 
construct his argument, including one vital but illegiti- 
mate step." It would be lovely to imagine that the great 
Fermat really was in possession of a proof, because the 
methods available to him would have been simpler than 
those used by Wiles. But it seems more likely that Fer- 
mat made a subtle but fatal error, one that would easily 
have gone undetected at that time.

Impossible Problems 



Dear Meg, 

Please don't try to trisect the angle. I'll send you 
some interesting problems to work on if you want to flex 
your research muscles already; just stay clear of angle tri- 
section. Why? Because you'll be wasting your time. 
Methods that go beyond the traditional unmarked ruler 
and compass are well known; methods that do not can- 
not possibly be correct. We know that because mathe- 
matics enjoys a privilege that is denied to most other 
walks of life. In mathematics, we can prove that some- 
thing is impossible. 

In most walks of life, "impossible" may mean any- 
thing from "I can't be bothered" to "No one knows how 
to do it" to "Those in charge will never agree." The sci- 
ence fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke famously wrote that 
"When an elderly and distinguished scientist declares 
something to be possible, he is very likely right. When 
he declares it to be impossible, he is almost certainly 



110 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

wrong." (Clarke was writing in 1963, when most scien- 
tists, especially elderly and distinguished ones, were al- 
most certainly "he.") But applied to mathematicians and 
mathematical theorems, Clarke's statement is plain 
wrong. A mathematical proof of impossibility is a virtu- 
ally unbreakable guarantee. 

I say "virtually" because sometimes the impossible 
can become possible if the question is subtly changed. 
Then, of course, it's not the same question. Archimedes 
knew how to trisect an angle using a marked ruler and 
compass. 

My favorite simple impossible problem is a puzzle. 
Though it looks frivolous at first glance, it provides a lot 
of insight into logical inference in mathematics, and in 
particular into how we know that some tasks are impos- 
sible. The puzzle is this: given a chessboard with two di- 
agonally opposite corners missing, can you cover it with 
thirty-one dominoes, each just the right size to cover 
two adjacent squares? 

It must be understood that no "cheating" is allowed. 
The dominoes must not overlap, or be cut up, or any- 
thing like that. 

The first question to ask is reasonably straightforward 
and comes naturally to any mathematician: is the area an 
obstacle to success? The total area of the mutilated chess- 
board is 64 — 2 = 62 squares. The total area of the domi- 
noes is 2 x 3 1 = 62 squares. So we have exactly the right 
number of dominoes to cover the chessboard. If we had 



111 



Ian Stewart 

been given only thirty, then calculating the total area 
would immediately have proved that the task is impossi- 
ble. But we've been given thirty-one, so the area is not 
an obstacle. 

Meg, I know you've done a lot of math, but it's just 
possible that you've never come across this puzzle. Puz- 
zles do not feature prominently in university textbooks. 
Please try it. For the moment, don't think about it; just 
cut out some cardboard dominoes and try to fit them 
together. 

Done that? Did you get anywhere? 

No. You tried and tried but nothing worked. You can 
see why if you count the black and white squares. 

Every domino, no matter where it is placed, covers 
one black and one white square of the chessboard. So any 
arrangement of nonoverlapping dominoes must cover 
the same number of black squares as white. But the muti- 
lated chessboard has thirty-two black squares and thirty 
white ones. No matter how you arrange the dominoes, 
two black squares (at least) must always stay empty. 

If instead, two adjacent corners are removed — one 
black, one white — this argument fails. And in fact, the 
puzzle can then be completed. But the "parity" argu- 
ment, counting the numbers of squares of the two colors 
and comparing them, rules out the version that I posed 
to begin with. The task is impossible . . . period. 

The deeper message behind this puzzle applies 
throughout mathematics. When a problem leads you to 



112 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

consider some huge number of possibilities — such as all 
the different ways the dominoes might be arranged — 
there is generally no practical way to deal with them one 
at a time. You must search for some common feature 
that does not change when you change the arrangement: 
an invariant. 

Here, the first invariant we tried was area. If you re- 
arrange the dominoes, their total area remains the same. 
But that invariant doesn't help here. So I resorted to a 
different invariant: the difference between the number 
of black squares and the number of white ones. This is 
always zero in any domino arrangement. So no arrange- 
ment in which the invariant is nonzero can be obtained 
by arranging dominoes according to our rules. 

The proof leaves open the possibility that some 
arrangements with zero invariant might not be possible 
for other reasons. In fact, these do exist; maybe you can 
find some. The "area" invariant solves some puzzles but 
not others. So does the "parity" invariant, odd or even. 
The same is true of most invariants. 

Now we must move on, from puzzles to serious 
mathematical problems. Remarkably, and delightfully, 
similar ideas still apply. 

Trisecting the angle is a case in point. We now 
know — we have known it since Gauss's student Pierre 
Wantzel wrote down a proof in 1837 — that it is impossi- 
ble to trisect the angle using an unmarked straightedge 
and compass. That is, there is no geometric construction, 



113 



Ian Stewart 



employing the traditional implements in the traditional 
manner, that will divide any given angle into three ex- 
actly equal parts. 

There are zillions of approximate constructions. 
None will be exact. I can say this without the slightest 
fear of contradiction and without examining any pro- 
posed method. We know it must contain a mistake. We 
don't know where or what the mistake is — and it may be 
very difficult to find — but we can be certain it's there. 

This, I know, sounds arrogant. It can be very annoy- 
ing to any would-be trisector. "How can they possibly 
know this when they haven't even looked at my proof?" 

They know because such a construction has been 
proved to be impossible. If someone claimed they could 
run a mile in ten seconds, you wouldn't have to watch 
them try it to know that there has to be a trick. Maybe 
they "run" using rocket assistance. Maybe their "mile" is 
not measured in the orthodox manner and is no longer 
than a bus. Maybe something is funny about their clock. 
We don't need to know which to smell a rat. 

It's like that in mathematics, but with a higher degree 
of certainty. 

Very well: how do we know that angle trisection is 
impossible? 

Although the problem concerned belongs to geome- 
try, its resolution belongs to algebra. This is a standard 
ploy in mathematical research: try transforming your 
problem into something that is logically equivalent but 



114 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

lies in a different area of mathematics. If you're fortu- 
nate, the new area will permit the use of new techniques, 
casting new light on the problem. The idea of replacing 
geometry with algebra — or the reverse — goes back at 
least to Rene Descartes. In an appendix to his Discours de 
la Methode of 1637, with the title La Geometrie, he out- 
lined the use of coordinates to turn geometric forms into 
algebraic equations, and back again. Today we call them 
Cartesian coordinates in his honor. 

The idea will be familiar to you, Meg. Any point in 
the plane can be characterized by two numbers, dis- 
tances measured in two directions at right angles to each 
other. Horizontal and vertical, or north/south and 
east/west. A line, circle, or other curve is just a collection 
of points, a set of pairs of numbers. Any statement about 
those lines and curves can be converted to a correspond- 
ing statement about numbers, and such statements be- 
long to the realm of algebra. Thus the fact that a circle 
has a radius of one unit, when converted into algebra us- 
ing Pythagoras 's theorem, becomes the fact that for any 
point on its circumference, the square of its horizontal 
coordinate, added to the square of its vertical coordinate, 
equals 1. In symbols, x 2 +y 2 = 1. This is the equation cor- 
responding to that circle. 

Every circle, every straight line, and every curve has a 
corresponding equation. And the points where, say, a 
circle meets a line are those pairs of numbers that satisfy 
both the equation for the circle and the equation for the 



115 



Ian Stewart 

line. Instead of drawing lines and curves and finding 
their intersections points, we can just solve equations. 
More importantly, instead of thinking about drawing 
lines and curves and finding their intersections points, 
we can think about solving the corresponding equations. 
And this is how we can prove that angles cannot be tri- 
sected in the manner specified. 

Here's how it goes, stripped of technical details. Any 
geometrical construction begins with a collection of 
points and then constructs new points by one of three 
methods. Either we draw two lines through existing 
points and find out where those lines meet; or we draw 
one such line and find where it meets a circle centered 
on a known point and passing through another known 
point; or we draw two such circles and see where they 
meet. This small set of moves is a product of our tools: a 
straightedge makes only straight lines, and a compass 
makes only circles. Thus we build new points out of old 
ones, and we continue for a finite number of such moves 
and then stop. 

This is another standard proof technique: break the 
problem down into the simplest possible parts. 

It may appear that an angle does not fit this descrip- 
tion. But an angle is specified by two lines that meet at a 
common point, and those two lines can be specified by 
the common point, another point on the first line, and 
another point on the second line. Three points suffice to 
define an angle. It takes only one further point to specify 



116 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

an angle one-third the size. But locating that fourth 
point may in principle require constructing a lot of aux- 
iliary points along the way, and the claim is that none of 
these will actually help. 

To see why, we apply another standard proof tech- 
nique: examine each of the simplest steps and try to find 
its essential features. 

Geometrically, there are three distinct steps: two lines, 
line plus circle, two circles. But if we convert those steps 
into algebra, we find that the first one is equivalent to 
solving a linear equation and the other two are equivalent 
to solving a quadratic equation. In a linear equation we 
are told that some multiple of the unknown, plus some 
number, is zero. In a quadratic equation we are told that 
some multiple of the square of the unknown, plus some 
multiple of the unknown, plus some number, is zero. 

Linear equations are "special cases" of quadratic 
ones: the relevant multiple of the square of the unknown 
is the multiple by zero. So all three steps boil down to 
solving quadratic equations. 

Methods for solving quadratic equations were known 
to the Babylonians in 2000 bc, and the basic idea is that 
you can always do it using square roots. In short, we 
have replaced "constructible using unmarked straight- 
edge and compass" by "expressible by a sequence of 
square roots (and other arithmetical operations such as 
addition and subtraction)." That characterizes all possi- 
ble points that can arise from geometric constructions. 



117 



Ian Stewart 

Suppose that some angle can be trisected using such 
a construction. Then the coordinates of the correspond- 
ing point — the one associated with an angle one-third 
the size — must be expressible by a sequence of square 
roots. Is that possible? Well, we know something about 
that new point, namely, that its coordinates are given by 
a cubic equation, one that also involves the cube of the 
unknown. This observation comes from trigonometry, 
where there is a standard formula relating the sine of an 
angle to the sine of three times that angle. 

The whole shebang, then, reduces to a simple ques- 
tion: given a number that you know is the solution of a 
cubic equation, is it possible to express that number using 
only square roots? The intuition is that there is a mis- 
match here: no sequence of steps involving the number 2 
should give rise to the number 3. A close examination of 
the properties of solutions of equations leads to an invari- 
ant, known as the degree. This has nothing to do with 
"degree" as a way to measure angles; it is a whole number 
specifying the type of equation that is being solved. 
Simple properties of the degree prove that the only time 
that you can solve a cubic equation using nothing more 
elaborate than square roots is when the cubic equation 
breaks down into a linear equation and a quadratic, or 
three linear ones. 

However, a short calculation shows that with rare 
exceptions, the cubic equation associated with angle tri- 
section is not like that. It does not break down. In partic- 



118 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

ular, this is the case when the initial angle is 60°, for ex- 
ample. Therefore the cubic equation cannot be solved 
exactly using only square roots. Indeed, if it could be 
solved in that manner, then the integer 3 would have to 
be an even number. But of course it isn't. 

I've left out the details — you can find them in many 
standard algebra texts if you want to see them — but I 
hope the story is clear. By transforming the geometry 
into algebra, we can reformulate angle trisection (in- 
deed any construction) as an algebraic question: can 
some number associated with the desired construction 
be expressed using square roots? If we know something 
useful about the number concerned — here, that it is 
given by a cubic equation — then we may be able to an- 
swer the algebraic version of the question. In this case, 
the algebra rules out any possibility that such a con- 
struction exists, thanks to the invariant known as the 
degree. 

It's not a matter of being clever: however cunning 
you are, your purported construction will necessarily be 
inexact. It might be very accurate (sadly, most attempts 
aren't; have a look at Underwood Dudley's A Budget of 
Trisectioni), but it cannot be exact. It's not a matter of 
finding other methods for trisecting angles, either: those 
are already known, and that wasn't the question. I always 
tell anyone who sends me an attempted trisection that 
I'm not concerned about their being wrong, and neither 
should they be. The problem is that if they are right, 



119 



Ian Stewart 

then a direct consequence of their proof is the fact that 3 
is an even number. 

Do they really want to go into the history books as 
claiming that? 

It doesn't put them off, mind you. No rational argu- 
ment ever diverts a true trisector from their innate cer- 
tainty that they are right. 

The "degree" invariant also explains why a regular 
seventeen-sided polygon can be constructed but a seven- 
sided one cannot. The corresponding degrees turn out 
to be one fewer than the number of sides: sixteen and six. 
Because 16 is the fourth power of 2, the seventeen-gon 
can be constructed by solving four successive quadratics. 
But 6 is not a power of 2, so no construction exists in 
that case. In my experience, angle trisectors seldom ob- 
ject to this deduction, although ironically, it implies that 
a valid trisection of the angle would lead directly to a 
construction of the regular seven-gon. 

There are many other impossible problems in mathe- 
matics. Angle trisection is one of three famous "problems 
of antiquity" credited to ancient Greek geometers, unfor- 
tunately without much historical justification, because 
the limitation to unmarked straightedge and compass was 
a later addition. The Greeks knew how to solve all three 
problems using more complex instruments. But it's true 
that this was the only way they knew how to solve them. 
Later mathematicians wondered whether anyone could 
do better, and eventually realized that they couldn't. 



120 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

The other two problems of antiquity are squaring the 
circle and duplicating the cube. That is, using the tradi- 
tional methods, construct a square whose area is equal to 
that of a given circle, or a cube with twice the volume of 
a given one. In modern terms, these problems ask for 
constructions for tt and the cube root of two, respec- 
tively. They can be proved impossible by similar meth- 
ods. In fact, the cube root of two evidently satisfies a 
cubic equation: its cube is two. And it satisfies no alge- 
braic equation whatsoever; but that's another story.

The Career Ladder 



Dear Meg, 

Don't mention it. I am always happy to treat you to a 
meal whenever we find ourselves in the same city, which, 
if you're genuinely intent on pursuing a career in re- 
search, could be increasingly often. 

But let me play devil's advocate for a moment. It's 
important to ask yourself whether you want to stay at 
university because that's where you feel most comfort- 
able. You should not be looking for "comfortable" at 
your age. 

Being a research mathematician is akin to being a 
writer or an artist: any glamour that's apparent to out- 
siders fades quickly in the face of the job's frustration, 
uncertainty, and hard, often solitary, work. You can't ex- 
pect your occasional moments in the spodight to make it 
all worthwhile. Unless you're more superficial than I be- 
lieve you are, they can't possibly. Your satisfaction must 
come from the high you get when you suddenly, for the 



122 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

first time, understand the problem you're working on 
and see your way to a solution. I use the word "high" ad- 
visedly. You need to be something like an addict for this 
feeling to provide sufficient recompense for all the work. 

Here's the paradox: though much of a mathemati- 
cian's work is solitary, even lonely, the most important 
aspect of your research is not the field you choose or the 
problems you embark on but how you deal with the 
people around you. 

When you set out to earn a PhD, you do not do so 
alone. Your fellow students will constitute an important 
support group; your department will function as your 
clan within the larger tribe of mathematicians around 
the world; above all, you will have a thesis adviser (or su- 
pervisor, as we say in the UK). Normally he or she will 
be an established expert with a solid track record in the 
area you plan to study. Sometimes it will be someone 
who completed their own PhD only a few years ago, in 
which case there will probably be a second, more senior 
adviser to add experience to the mix. 

A young adviser is often an excellent choice. They 
are usually bubbling over with ideas, and having just 
come through the academic mill themselves, they will 
probably be more sympathetic to your struggles. 

In the April 1991 issue of The Psychologist, my sociol- 
ogist friend Helen Haste analyzed the patterns of gift- 
giving among the remote and backward peoples known 
as "academics." The article was an anthropological spoof, 



123 



Ian Stewart 



but it made some telling points. The gifts were copies of 
research papers, and the article classified academics into 
a six-rung career ladder, plus one unorthodox role that 
sticks out sideways. 

You are about to join the first rung of the ladder by 
becoming a DXGS: Dr. X's graduate student. From 
there you will, I'm sure, progress rapidly to PYR, prom- 
ising young researcher, and thence to ER, established re- 
searcher. If you elect to remain in academia, the 
succeeding grades are SS (senior scientist), GOP (grand 
old person), and EG (emeritus guru). 

As a DXGS you will not yet have produced any ritual 
gifts of your own, and so cannot present them to anyone. 
You can request them, but normally only from your 
peers. When performing before the tribe — that is, giv- 
ing seminars — you will repeatedly invoke two ancestors, 
a major theorist and your thesis adviser. The PYR is 
more relaxed and understands the rituals better. He or 
she will still invoke those two ancestors, but briefly and 
often as mere footnotes. Astute PYRs invoke SSs in- 
stead. They travel to tribal meetings (conferences) so 
laden with gifts that the journey is more like a pilgrim- 
age, and dispense them liberally. They also feel able to 
request gifts from their seniors, though not too often 
and always politely. The ER seldom refers to a major 
theorist, preferring to mention only ancestors who are 
currently active, but — tellingly — an ER may also men- 
tion progeny, to prove that he or she has them. The ER 



124 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

does not bring gifts to the tribal meeting, having cleverly 
dispensed them in advance to the tribe's inner circle. 

The SS invokes a major theorist frequently, with the 
goal of supplanting him or her by being seen to have 
made important advances over the major theorist's ideas. 
The SS never gives or receives in public but expects to 
receive many gifts by more covert means. The GOP sits 
at the pinnacle of the gift-giving hierarchy, offering no 
gifts but requesting them from everyone, especially jun- 
iors. The EG is invoked as an ancestor by almost every- 
one, but takes part in absolutely no exchanges of gifts. 

The role that does not fit into this sequence — in- 
deed, does not fit anywhere, which is its raison d'etre, is 
the maverick guru (MG). Helen has this to say about 
MGs: "The Maverick Guru has an important symbolic 
role, having curious magical powers that cause fear and 
fascination in the community. The MG is outside the 
mainstream orthodoxy, but engaged in criticizing it. The 
MG cannot be invoked as an ancestor by junior mem- 
bers of the community who intend to stay within the 
mainstream . . . An erstwhile MG rapidly becomes a 
GOP." 

I mention all this because you need to appreciate 
your place within the tribe, and because your progres- 
sion from DXGS to PYR to ER depends heavily on your 
choice of X, who should be either an ER, an SS, or per- 
haps a GOP. Do not choose an MG> no matter how attrac- 
tive that option may seem, unless you intend your entire

career to operate outside the conventional ladder. And 
on the whole, I advise you to stay clear of GOPs. Trust 
me: I wanted to become an MG but I think I've ended 
up as a GOP instead. A GOP will have an impressive 
record, but much of it will date to the dim and distant 
past: five years ago, or even longer. The older an aca- 
demic becomes, the more intellectual baggage he car- 
ries. GOPs' minds tend to run along familiar grooves, 
and although they do this with impressive ease and con- 
fidence, their students may miss out on the really new 
ideas that are the lifeblood of research. Some GOPs, 
though, make excellent advisers despite that, usually 
those who are close to being MGs but aren't quite. 

EGs never have students. 

My adviser was an SS in the field of group theory — 
the formal mathematics of symmetry — named Brian 
Hartley. He was young, but not too young. I didn't 
choose him, and he didn't exactly choose me either; I 
chose the field, and the system allocated me to him be- 
cause he was in that field. There were four or five alter- 
native choices. Any of them would have worked — I later 
got to know them all well, as colleagues — but my re- 
search would have been very different. I was very lucky 
to get Brian, who put me onto a problem — more an en- 
tire program — that really suited my interests and abili- 
ties. He was brilliant. He saw me regularly, was always 
available if I got stuck, and he was hardly ever stumped 
for an idea. 



126 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

Brian was, I think, slightly taken aback when I 
marched into his office on day one of my PhD course 
and demanded a research problem. Usually it takes stu- 
dents longer to get going. But within half an hour he 
had given me one — arising from one of his own papers, 
my first receipt of a gift — and it turned out to be a 
beauty. The program of research was to study a special 
type of group that a Russian mathematician, Anatoly 
Ivanovich Malcev, had associated with a different math- 
ematical structure called a Lie algebra. This structure 
was first developed over a century ago by the Norwe- 
gian Sophus Lie, but (despite its name) it was mainly 
studied in the context of analysis, not abstract algebra. 
So Malcev's purely algebraic version was a new point of 
view. Like many Russians at the time, he had sketched 
the ideas but not developed them in detail. My problem 
was to take Malcev's thoughts and conjectures, and fill 
in the necessary proofs and other connections, in effect, 
to turn a set of sketches and renderings into a finished 
blueprint of a building. It took me three months, and I 
got hooked by Lie theory. I ended up writing my entire 
thesis on Lie algebras. 

Brian's influence did not stop at research problems. 
He and his wife, Mary, entertained me and other PhD 
students at their home. Occasionally he invited me to 
join him at some jazz performance in a local pub. He was 
an academic father figure, a mentor, and a friend. In 1994 
he died, unexpectedly, at the age of 55 while walking in 



127 



Ian Stewart 

the hills near Manchester. I wrote his obituary for The 
Guardian. It ended like this: "I last saw Brian a few weeks 
ago, at a meeting to mark the sixtieth birthday of a mu- 
tual friend. He had just taken up a much-prized fellow- 
ship that would relieve him of all teaching duties for five 
years to concentrate on research. He went out with his 
boots on, both literally, while walking in his beloved 
hills, and metaphorically. And that is how we shall all re- 
member him." 

I still find it hard to accept that he's gone. 

As I say, I was lucky. The system assigned me the 
ideal adviser. But you can do better than that. Don't 
leave it up to chance: choose your thesis adviser. Read the 
literature, talk to people in the field, find out who has a 
good reputation and — crucially — who is good with stu- 
dents. Draw up a short list. Visit them; in effect, inter- 
view them. Then trust your instincts. And remember, 
you don't want a GOP who ignores you; you want a 
close personal relationship. 

Dare I add, not too close? The cliche of faculty sleep- 
ing with their students exists because it does happen. 
Someone once observed that the more subjective the 
discipline, the better the faculty dressed, and a similar 
principle seems to apply to illicit sex. Mathematicians, 
by and large, indulge in rather less of it, perhaps be- 
cause we dress so badly. In any case, everyone knows it's 
unprofessional, and nowadays there are sexual harass- 
ment laws. Enough said. For recreation and affection,

restrict yourself to fellow students, or people from off 
campus, please. 

A standard joke states that mathematical ability is 
typically passed from father to son-in-law (or, these days, 
from mother to daughter-in-law). The point was that a 
male PhD student often married his adviser's daughter. 
It's one way to meet people off campus. So your real an- 
cestry can be affected by your mathematical ancestry. 

Mathematicians are proud to trace their academic 
lineage through thesis advisers. Brian was my mathemat- 
ical father, and Philip Hall my grandfather. Hall was of a 
generation for whom a PhD was unnecessary as a quali- 
fication for a university profession, but the most signifi- 
cant influence on his early work was William Burnside. 
Burnside can similarly be considered a mathematical son 
of Arthur Cayley, one of the most famous English math- 
ematicians of Victorian times. 

I remember these things and value them. I know 
where and how I fit into the family tree of mathematical 
thought. Arthur Cayley is as important an ancestor to 
me as any of my biological great-great-grandfathers. 

Talent must be passed to succeeding generations. I've 
been thesis adviser to thirty students so far, twenty men 
and ten women. Since 1985, the proportions are fifty 
percent men, fifty percent women. I know women are 
just as good at math as men because I've watched both at 
close quarters. I am particularly proud of my mathemat- 
ical daughters, most of whom hail from Portugal, where 



129 



Ian Stewart 

mathematics has long been viewed as a suitable activity 
for women. All of my Portuguese daughters have re- 
mained in mathematics. In fact, most of my graduate 
students have remained in mathematics, and every single 
one of them earned a PhD. However, one is now an ac- 
countant, several work in computing, and one owns an 
electronics company, or at least he did the last time I 
heard from him. 

The rest of the world is now following Portugal's 
lead. In July 2005 the American Mathematical Society 
released the results of its 2004 Annual Survey of the 
Mathematical Sciences. Since the early 1 990s, women have 
been receiving around 45 percent of all first degrees in 
math. Women received almost one-third of all U.S. doc- 
torates in the mathematical sciences in the academic 
year 2003-2004, and one-quarter of those awarded in 
the top forty-eight math departments. In all, 333 women 
received math PhDs that year, the largest number ever 
recorded. 

The idea that math is not a suitable subject for 
women is stone-cold dead. The career ladder is open to 
both sexes, though it is still unbalanced at the top end.

Pure or Applied? 



Dear Meg, 

When you're choosing a subject area as a first-year 
grad student in mathematics, many people will tell you 
that your biggest choice is whether to study pure or ap- 
plied mathematics. 

The short answer is that you should do both. A 
slightly longer version adds that the distinction is un- 
helpful and is rapidly becoming untenable. "Pure" and 
"applied" do represent two distinct approaches to our 
subject, but they are not in competition with each 
other. The physicist Eugene Wigner once commented 
on the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" for 
providing insight into the natural world, and his 
choice of words makes it clear that he was talking 
about pure mathematics. Why should such abstract 
formulations, seemingly divorced from any connection 
to reality, be relevant to so many areas of science? Yet 
they are. 



131 



Ian Stewart 



There are many styles of mathematics, and while 
these two styles happen to have names, they merely rep- 
resent two points on a spectrum of mathematical 
thought. Pure mathematics merges into logic and phi- 
losophy, and applied math merges into mathematical 
physics and engineering. They are tendencies, not the 
extremes of the spectrum. By an accident of history, 
these two tendencies have created an administrative split 
in academic mathematics: many universities place pure 
mathematics and applied mathematics in different de- 
partments. They used to fight tooth and nail over every 
new appointment and committee representative, but 
lately they are getting on rather better. 

As caricatured by applied mathematicians, pure 
math is abstract ivory-tower intellectual nonsense with 
no practical implications. Applied math, respond the 
pure-math diehards, is intellectually sloppy, lacks rigor, 
and substitutes number crunching for understanding. 
Like all good caricatures, both statements contain 
grains of truth, but you should not take them literally. 
Nevertheless, you will occasionally encounter these ex- 
aggerated attitudes, just as you will encounter throw- 
backs who still believe that women are no good at math 
and science. Ignore them; their time has passed. They 
just haven't noticed. 

Timothy Poston, a mathematical colleague whom I 
have known for thirty-five years, wrote a penetrating ar- 
ticle in 1981 in Mathematics Tomorrow. He observed — to 



132 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

paraphrase a complex argument — that the "purity" of 
pure mathematics is not that of an idle princess who re- 
fuses to sully her hands with good, honest work, but a 
purity of method. In pure math, you are not permitted to 
cut corners or leap to unjustified conclusions, however 
plausible. As Tim said, "Conceptual thinking is the salt 
of mathematics. If the salt has lost its savor, with what 
shall applications be salted?" 

A middle ground, dubbed "applicable mathematics," 
emerged in the 1970s, but the name never really got es- 
tablished. My view is that all areas of mathematics are 
potentially applicable, although — as with equality in An- 
imal Farm — some are more applicable than others. I pre- 
fer a single name, mathematics, and I believe it should 
be housed within a single university department. The 
emphasis nowadays is on developing the unity of over- 
lapping areas of math and science, not imposing artificial 
boundaries. 

It has taken us a while to reach this happy state of 
affairs. 

Back in the days of Euler and Gauss, nobody distin- 
guished between the internal structure of mathematics 
and the way it was used. Euler would write on the 
arrangement of masts in ships one day and on elliptic in- 
tegrals the next. Gauss was immortalized by his work in 
number theory, including such gems as the law of quad- 
ratic reciprocity, but he also took time out to compute 
the orbit of Ceres, the first known asteroid. An empirical 



133

regularity in the spacing of the planets, the Titius-Bode 
law, predicted an unknown planet orbiting between 
Mars and Jupiter. In 1801 the Italian astronomer 
Giuseppe Piazzi discovered a celestial body in a suitable 
orbit and named it Ceres. The observations were so 
sparse that astronomers despaired of locating Ceres 
again when it reappeared from behind the sun. Gauss re- 
sponded by improving the methods for calculating or- 
bits, inventing such trifles as least-squares data fitting 
along the way. The work made him famous, and diverted 
him into celestial mechanics; even so, his greatest work 
is generally felt to have been in pure math. 

Gauss went on to conduct geographical surveys and 
to invent the telegraph. No one could accuse him of be- 
ing impractical. In applied mathematics, he was a genius. 
But in pure mathematics, he was a god. 

By the time the nineteenth century merged into the 
twentieth, mathematics had become too big for any one 
person to encompass it all. People started to specialize. 
Researchers gravitated toward areas of mathematics 
whose methods appealed to them. Those who liked puz- 
zling out strange patterns and relished the logical strug- 
gles required to find proofs specialized in the more 
abstract parts of the mathematical landscape. Practical 
types who wanted answers were drawn to areas that bor- 
dered on physics and engineering. 

By 1960 this divergence had become a split. What 
pure mathematicians considered mainstream — analysis, 



134 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

topology, algebra — had wandered off into realms of ab- 
straction that were severely uncongenial to those of a 
practical turn of mind. Meanwhile, applied mathemati- 
cians were sacrificing logical rigor to extract numbers 
from increasingly difficult equations. Getting an answer 
became more important than getting the right answer, 
and any argument that led to a reasonable solution was 
acceptable, even if no one could explain why it worked. 
Physics students were told not to take courses from 
mathematicians because it would destroy their minds. 

Rather too many of the people involved in this de- 
bate failed to notice that there was no particular reason 
to restrict mathematical activity to one style of thought. 
There was no good reason to assume that either pure 
math was good and applied math was bad, or the other 
way around. But many people took these positions any- 
way. The pure mathematicians didn't help by being os- 
tentatiously unconcerned about the utility of anything 
they did; many, like Hardy, were proud that their work 
had no practical value. In retrospect, there was one good 
reason for this, among several bad ones. The pursuit of 
generality led to a close examination of the structure of 
mathematics, and this in turn revealed some big gaps in 
our understanding of the subject's foundations. Assump- 
tions that had seemed so obvious that no one realized 
they were assumptions turned out to be false. 

For instance, everyone had assumed that any contin- 
uous curve must have a well-defined tangent, almost 



135

everywhere, though of course not at sharp corners, 
which is why "everywhere" was clearly too strong a 
statement. Equivalently, every continuous function must 
be differentiable almost everywhere. 

Not so. Karl Weierstrass found a simple continuous 
function that is differentiable nowhere. 

Does this matter? Similar difficulties plagued the area 
known as Fourier analysis for a century, to such an extent 
that no one was sure which theorems were right and 
which were wrong. None of that stopped engineers from 
making good use of Fourier analysis. But one conse- 
quence of the struggle to sort the whole area out was the 
creation of measure theory, which later provided the 
foundations of the theory of probability. Another was 
fractal geometry, one of the most promising ways to un- 
derstand nature's irregularities. Problems of rigor seldom 
affect immediate, direct applications of mathematical 
concepts. But sorting these problems out usually reveals 
elegant new ideas, important in some other area of appli- 
cation, that might otherwise have been missed. 

Leaving conceptual difficulties unresolved is a bit 
like using new credit cards to pay off the debts on old 
ones. You can keep going like that for some time, but 
eventually the bills come due. 

The style of mathematical thinking needed to sort 
out Fourier analysis was unfamiliar even to pure mathe- 
maticians. All too often, it seemed the objective was not 
to prove new theorems but to devise fiendishly compli- 



136 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

cated examples that placed limits on existing ones. Many 
pure mathematicians were disturbed by these examples, 
deeming them "pathological" and "monstrous," and 
hoped that if they were ignored they would somehow go 
away. To his credit, David Hilbert, one of the leading 
mathematicians of the early 1 900s, disagreed, referring 
to the newly emerging area as a "paradise." It took a 
while for most mathematicians to see his point. By the 
1960s, however, they had taken it on board to such an 
extent that their minds were focused almost exclusively 
on sorting out the internal difficulties of the big mathe- 
matical theories. When your understanding of topology 
does not permit you to distinguish a reef knot from a 
granny knot, it seems pointless to worry about applica- 
tions. Those must wait until we've sorted this stuff out; 
don't expect me to build a cocktail cabinet when I'm still 
trying to sharpen the saw. 

It did look a bit Ivory Tower. But collectively, mathe- 
maticians had not forgotten that the most important cre- 
ative force in mathematics is its link to the natural world. 
As the theories became more powerful and the gaps were 
filled, individuals picked up the new kit of tools and 
started using them. They began wading into territory 
that had belonged to the applied mathematicians, who 
objected to the interlopers and weren't comfortable with 
their methods. 

Mark Kac, a probabilist with interests in many other 
areas of application, wrote an amusing and penetrating 



137 



Ian Stewart 

analysis of the pure mathematicians' tendency to refor- 
mulate applied problems in abstract terms. He likened 
their approach to the invention of "dehydrated ele- 
phants": technically difficult, but of no practical value. 
My friend Tim Poston pointed out that this is a poor 
analogy. It is actually rather easy to create a dehydrated 
elephant. The important technical issue is quite differ- 
ent: it is to ensure that when you add water, you get back 
a fully functioning elephant. Hannibal, he said, could 
have done with a cartload of dehydrated elephants when 
he marched on Rome. 

Metaphors notwithstanding, Kac had a point: ab- 
stract reformulations are not an end in themselves. But 
he ruined it completely by offering an example. My 
wife's father made the same mistake in the 1950s when 
he said, correctly, that most pop stars would never last, 
but then offered as his example Elvis Presley. Kac's ex- 
ample of an archetypal dehydrated elephant was Steven 
Smale's recasting of classical mechanics in terms of 
"symplectic geometry." It would be too great a diversion 
to explain this new kind of geometry, but suffice it to say 
that Smale's idea is now seen as a profound application 
of topology to physics. 

Another vocal critic of abstraction in math was John 
Hammersley. A severely practical man and a consum- 
mate problem solver, Hammersley watched with dismay 
as the "new math" of the 1960s took over school curric- 
ula worldwide, and things like solving quadratic equa- 



138

tions were dumped in favor of gluing Mobius strips to- 
gether to see how many sides and edges they had. In 
1968 he wrote a celebrated diatribe called "On the En- 
feeblement of Mathematical Skills by 'Modern Mathe- 
matics' and by Similar Soft Intellectual Trash in Schools 
and Universities." 

Like Kac, he had a point, but it would have been a 
much better point if he had not been so certain that any- 
thing he didn't like was trash. "Abstract" is a verb as well as 
an adjective; generalities are abstracted from specifics. It is 
best to teach the specifics before performing the abstrac- 
tion. But in the late 1960s, educators were throwing out 
the specifics. They had convinced themselves that it was 
more important to know that 7+11 = 11 + 7 than to know 
that either of them was 18, and even better to know that a 
+ b - b + a without having a clue what a and b were. I can 
understand why Hammersley was livid. But ... oh dear. 
From today's vantage point he looks like a knee-jerk reac- 
tionary. It turns out that that "soft intellectual trash" con- 
sisted of useful and important ideas, but ideas best taught 
in a university, not high school. At its frontiers, mathemat- 
ics had to become general and abstract: otherwise there 
could be no progress. Looking back on the 1960s from the 
twenty-first century, when the work of that period is bear- 
ing fruit, I think Hammersley failed to appreciate that new 
applications would need new tools, or that the theories be- 
ing developed so assiduously by the pure mathematicians 
would be a major source of those tools. 



139 



Ian Stewart 

What Hammersley denigrated forty years ago as 
"soft intellectual trash" is precisely what I use today to 
work on problems in fluid mechanics, evolutionary biol- 
ogy, and neuroscience. I use group theory, the funda- 
mental language of symmetry, to understand the 
generalities of pattern formation and the application of 
those ideas to many areas of science. So do hundreds of 
others in math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, engineer- 
ing, and biology. 

People who are proud to be "practical" bother me 
just as much as those who are proud not to be. Both can 
suffer from blinkered vision. I am reminded of the 
chemist Thomas Midgley, Jr., who devoted much of his 
professional life to two major inventions: Freon and 
leaded gasoline. Freon is a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), 
and this class of chemicals was responsible for the hole 
on the ozone layer and is now largely banned. Lead in 
gasoline is also banned, because of its adverse effects on 
health, especially that of children. Sometimes a narrow 
focus on immediate practicalities can cause trouble later. 
It is easy to be wise after the event, of course, and the 
catalytic reactions on ice crystals that made apparendy 
stable CFCs have such a damaging effect on the upper 
atmosphere were difficult to anticipate. But leaded gaso- 
line was always a bad idea. 

It's fine for people to advocate their point of view 
on how math should be done. But they should not pre- 
sume that there is only one good way to do math. I

value diversity, Meg, and I urge you to do the same. I 
also value imagination, and I encourage you to develop 
yours and use it. It takes a strong mixture of imagina- 
tion and skepticism to see that what's currently in fash- 
ion will not always be so, or that what your colleagues 
dismiss as a fad may be something considerably more. 
Today's trendy fashion sometimes turns out to be 
threaded with pure gold. 

Keep your mind open, but not so open that your 
brains fall out. 

Over the years, a number of new areas of math have 
emerged from a diversity of sources, inspired by ques- 
tions in the real world, or extracted from abstract theo- 
ries because someone thought they were interesting. 
Some have attracted media attention, including fractal 
geometry, nonlinear dynamics ("chaos theory"), and 
complex systems. Fractals are shapes that have detailed 
structure on all scales of magnification, like ferns and 
mountains. Chaos is highly irregular behavior (such as 
weather) caused by deterministic laws. Complex systems 
model the interactions of large numbers of relatively 
simple entities, such as traders in the stock market. In 
the professional literature and mathematical house mag- 
azines, you will occasionally find criticisms of these areas 
that have that all -too-familiar reactionary feel: dismissive 
of anything that hasn't had a century-long track record 
or that the critic does not work on. What has really an- 
noyed the critics is not the content of these new areas 



141 



Ian Stewart 

but the media exposure, which their own area, so obvi- 
ously superior, is not getting. 

It's actually rather easy to assess the scientific influ- 
ence of, for instance, fractals or chaos. All you have to do 
is read Nature or Science for a month, and you will see 
them being used to investigate such things as how mole- 
cules break up during a chemical reaction, how gas giant 
planets capture new moons, or how species in an ecosys- 
tem partition resources. The scientific community ac- 
cepted them long ago, to the extent that their use is now 
routine and unremarkable. Yet some diehards, who ap- 
parently don't sample broader reaches of science, still 
dispute that these areas have any importance. I'm afraid 
that they are about twenty years out of date. You can't 
dismiss something as a nine-day wonder when it has sur- 
vived for nine thousand days and is currently thriving. 

These people need to get out more. 

Both Kac and Hammersley were unusually creative 
in their own fields, where their attitudes were imagina- 
tive and forward-looking. So it is slightly unfair to hold 
them up as examples of reactionary mathematicians. 
They expressed attitudes that were common in their day. 
Kac made major advances in probability theory, and his 
"shape of a drum" paper is a gem. Hammersley's 2004 
obituary in the Independent on Friday had this to say 
about his work: "Hammersley . . . posed and solved some 
beautiful problems, among the best of which are self- 
avoiding [random] walks and percolation. He was de-

Letters to a Young Mathematician 

lighted to learn in retirement of the recognition ac- 
corded thereto by mathematicians and physicists, and of 
the enormous progress made since his own pioneering 
work." But it added, "Ironically, recent progress has 
been made via a general theory rather than by the type 
of hands-on technique favoured by Hammersley." 

This may be ironic but it is also entirely predictable. 
Hammersley was from the make-do-and-mend genera- 
tion of applied mathematicians. Nowadays, more atten- 
tion is paid to having the right tools for the job. 

We live in a world whose technological abilities, and 
needs, are exploding. New questions require new meth- 
ods, and purity of method remains vital, however practi- 
cal the context. So do intuitive leaps, when they lead in 
creative directions, even if at first there are no proofs: 
new mathematics paves the way to new understanding. 
Which brings me back to Wigner and his classic essay 
"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the 
Natural Sciences." Wigner wasn't just wondering why 
mathematics is effective in informing us about nature. 
Many people have picked up on this aspect of the issue, 
and offered what I think is an excellent answer: whether 
or not any particular mathematician notices, the devel- 
opment of mathematics is, and has always been, a two- 
way trade between real-world problems and symbolic or 
geometric methods devised to obtain answers. Of course 
math is effective for understanding nature; that, ulti- 
mately, is where it comes from. 



143 



Ian Stewart 

But I think Wigner was worried — or pleasantly sur- 
prised — by something deeper. There is no reason to be 
astonished if someone starts from a real-world prob- 
lem — say, the elliptical orbit of Mars — and develops the 
mathematics to describe it. This is exactly what Isaac 
Newton did with his inverse square law of gravity, his 
laws of motion, and calculus. But it is much more diffi- 
cult to explain why the same tools (differential equations 
in this instance) provide significant insights into unre- 
lated questions of aerodynamics or population biology. 
It is here that the effectiveness of math becomes "unrea- 
sonable." It's like inventing a clock to tell the time and 
then discovering that it's really good for navigation, 
which actually happened, as Dava Sobel explained in 
Longitude. 

How can an idea extracted from a particular real- 
world problem resolve some totally different problem? 

Some scientists believe that it happens because the 
universe really is made from mathematics. John Barrow 
argues the case like this: "For the fundamental physicist, 
mathematics is something that is altogether more per- 
suasive. The farther one goes from everyday experience 
and the local world, the correct apprehension of which is 
a prerequisite for our evolution and survival, the more 
impressively mathematics works. In the inner space of 
elementary particles or the outer space of astronomy, the 
predictions of mathematics are almost unreasonably ac- 
curate. . . . This has persuaded many physicists that the 



144 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

view that mathematics is simply a cultural creation is a 
woefully inadequate explanation of its existence and ef- 
fectiveness in describing the world. ... If the world is 
mathematical at its deepest level, then mathematics is 
the analogy that never breaks down." 

It would be lovely if this were true. But there is a dif- 
ferent explanation, less mystical, less fundamentalist. 
Possibly less convincing. 

Both differential equations and clocks are tools, not 
answers. They work by embedding the original problem 
in a more general context, and deriving general methods 
to understand that context. This generality improves 
their chance of being useful elsewhere. This is why their 
effectiveness appears unreasonable. 

You can't always know in advance what uses you'll 
find for a good tool. A round piece of wood mounted on 
an axle becomes a wheel, useful for moving heavy ob- 
jects. Cut a groove in its circumference and drape a rope 
around it, and the wheel becomes a pulley with which 
you can not only move objects but lift them. Make the 
wheel out of metal instead of wood, add teeth instead of 
a groove, and you have a gear. Put your gears and pulleys 
together with a few other elements — a pendulum, some 
weights, a face abstracted from an ancient sundial — and 
you have a mechanism for telling time, which is some- 
thing the wheel's original inventors could never have an- 
ticipated. The pure mathematicians of the 1960s were 
forging tools that could be used by everyone in the

1980s. I have great respect for the Hammersleys of this 
world, much as I respect a large Alsatian dog I meet in 
the street. My respect for the dog's teeth does not lead 
me to agree with its opinions. If everyone adopted the 
attitudes advocated by Kac and Hammersley, no one 
would develop the crazy ideas that create revolutions. 

So: should you study pure math or applied math? 

Neither. You should use the tools at hand, adapt and 
modify them to suit your own projects, and make new 
ones as the need arises.

B Where Do You Get Those 
Crazy Ideas? 



Dear Meg, 

It's easy to make research sound glamorous: grap- 
pling with problems at the cutting edge of human 
thought, making discoveries that will last a thousand 
years . . . There is certainly nothing quite like it. All it 
requires is an original mind, time to think, a place where 
you can work, access to a good library, access to a good 
computer system, a photocopier, and a fast Internet con- 
nection. All of these will be provided for you as part of 
your PhD course, except for the first item, which you 
will have to provide for yourself. 

This is, of course, the sine qua non, the thing with- 
out which all the other items are useless. Normally, stu- 
dents are not admitted to a PhD course unless they have 
shown some evidence of original thinking, maybe in a 
project or a master's thesis. Originality is one of those 
things that you either have or you don't: it can't be 



147 



Ian Stewart 

taught. It can be nurtured or suppressed, but there isn't 
an Originality 101 course that will anoint you as able to 
think new thoughts provided you have read the textbook 
and passed the exam. 

In saying this, I recognize that I am at odds with the 
prevailing view among educational psychologists, 
which is that anybody can achieve anything provided 
they undergo sufficient training. Observing that tal- 
ented musicians practice a lot, the psychologists have 
deduced that it is practice that causes talent, and gener- 
alized that assertion to all other areas of intellectual ac- 
tivity. But their beliefs are founded on bad experimental 
design. What they must do, to test their theory, is to 
start with lots of people who lack musical talent, say, the 
certifiably tone-deaf. Train half of them, keeping the 
other half as a control group, and show that the training 
produces lots of highly talented musicians while its ab- 
sence (predictably) does not. I am sure that training can 
lead to some improvement. I do not believe it can pro- 
duce a decent musician unless the talent was there to 
begin with. 

I am no Mozart. I have some musical talent, but not 
enough, and it's not for lack of practice. Training can get 
me to a reasonable level of proficiency: as an undergrad- 
uate I played lead guitar in a rock band. But all the prac- 
tice in the world could never turn me into a Jimi 
Hendrix or Eric Clapton, never mind Mozart. As Ed- 
ward Bulwer-Lytton said, "Genius does what it must, 



148 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

and talent does what it can." I have just enough musical 
talent to know what's lacking. 

I do have mathematical talent. Not at the Mozart 
level, but a big improvement on my guitar playing. By 
age ten I was already the best in my class at math, and 
believe me, it did not come from lots of regular practice. 
My dreadful secret is that I did very little work on math. 
I didn't have to. My classmates thought I must have put 
in hours and hours of effort in order to wipe the floor 
with them in the math tests, and I had enough sense not 
to set them straight. They would have killed me if they 
had known how little time I spent on the math home- 
work, compared to their own strenuous efforts. 

When I was an undergraduate, at Churchill College, 
Cambridge, I had a friend who was also taking a math de- 
gree. He worked twelve hours a day, every day. I went to 
lectures, scribbled notes, spent an hour or two a week 
working through the problem sheets, and that was it until 
it was time to revise the material for the end-of-year 
exams. In the British system at that time, there were no 
end-of-term tests. You waited until June and then you took 
exams on everything you had studied over the year. So I 
worked harder in April and May than I did the rest of the 
year. But while my friend was studying late into the night, 
I was down at the pub having a beer and playing darts. And 
what was his reward for all that training? He barely 
scraped a pass. Whereas I got first-class marks (the British 
equivalent of straight As) and a College Scholarship. 



149 



Ian Stewart 

It is true that talented people often train very hard. 
They have to, to stay at the pinnacle of their chosen 
field. A football player who did not spend hours every 
day on fitness training would quickly be replaced by one 
who did. But the talent has to be there initially in order 
for the training to be effective. 

I suspect that psychologists overrate the role of train- 
ing because they have fallen for a politically correct the- 
ory of child development that views all new young minds 
as "blank slates" upon which anything whatsoever can be 
written. This theory was comprehensively demolished 
by Steven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate, but defini- 
tive refutation has never been a match for fervent belief. 

Anyway, Meg, since you have been accepted onto a 
PhD course, the mathematicians who run it clearly be- 
lieve you possess sufficient originality to complete it 
successfully. I am in no doubt that you also possess an- 
other essential quality: commitment. You want to do re- 
search; you are hungry for it. One of my colleagues 
once said to me, "I really can't tell who the best mathe- 
maticians are, but I can tell who is driven" Some people 
believe that in career terms, once you assume a fairly or- 
dinary level of competence, energy and drive actually 
matter more than talent. 

Science fiction writers, another profession where 
originality is essential, are often asked, "Where do you 
get those crazy ideas?" The standard answer is, "We 
make them up." I've written sci-fi novels, and I concur. 



150 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

But authors do not make up ideas from nowhere. They 
immerse themselves in activities that might generate 
ideas, such as reading science magazines, and they keep 
their antennae tuned for the faintest hint of an idea. 

Mathematicians get ideas the same way. They read 
the math journals, they think about applications, and 
they keep their antennae tuned to "high." 

Still, the very best seem to have other ways of think- 
ing fresh thoughts. It's almost as if they lived on another 
planet. Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant self-taught 
Indian mathematician whose life story is very romantic; 
it is well told in Robert KanigePs The Man Who Knew In- 
finity. I prefer to think of Ramanujan as Formula Man. 
He learned most of his early mathematics from a single, 
rather curious textbook, George Carr's A Synopsis of Ele- 
mentary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics. It was a 
list of about five thousand mathematical formulas, start- 
ing with simple algebra and leading into complicated in- 
tegrals in calculus and the summation of infinite series. 
The book must have appealed to Ramanujan's turn of 
mind, or he would never have worked his way through 
it; on the other hand, it led him to think (because he had 
no one to tell him otherwise) that the essence of mathe- 
matics is the derivation of formulas. 

There is more to math than that: proof, for a start, 
and conceptual structure. But new formulas play a part, 
and Ramanujan was a wizard at them. He came to the 
attention of Western mathematicians in 1913 when he 



151 



Ian Stewart 

sent a list of some of his formulas to Hardy. Looking at 
this list, Hardy saw some formulas he could recognize 
as known results, but many others were so strange that 
he had no idea where they could have come from. The 
man was either a crackpot or a genius; Hardy and his 
colleague John Littlewood retired to a quiet room with 
the list, determined not to come out until they had de- 
cided which. 

The verdict was "genius," and Ramanujan was even- 
tually brought to Cambridge, where he collaborated 
with Hardy and Littlewood. He died young, of tubercu- 
losis, and he left a series of notebooks that even today 
are a treasure trove of new formulas. 

When asked where his formulas came from, Ra- 
manujan replied that the Hindu goddess Namagiri came 
to him in dreams, and told them to him. He had grown 
up in the shadow of the Sarangapani temple, and Nama- 
giri was his family deity. As I told you in an earlier letter, 
Hadamard and Poincare emphasized the crucial role of 
the subconscious mind in the discovery of new mathe- 
matics. I think Ramanujan's dreams of Namagiri were 
surface traces of the hidden activity of his subconscious. 

One can't aspire to be a Ramanujan. His kind of tal- 
ent is uncanny; I suspect that the only way to understand 
it is to possess it, and even then it probably yields very 
little to introspection. 

As a contrast, let me try to describe how I usually get 
new ideas, which is far more prosaic. I read a lot, often in 



152 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

fields unrelated to my own, and my best ideas often 
come when something I have read reminds me of some- 
thing I already know about. That was how I came to 
work on animal locomotion. 

The origin of this particular set of ideas goes back to 
1983, when I spent a year in Houston working with 
Marty Golubitsky. We developed a general theory of 
space-time patterns in periodic dynamics. That is, we 
looked at systems whose behavior over time repeats the 
same sequence over and over again. The simplest ex- 
ample is a pendulum, which swings periodically from left 
to right and right to left. If you place a pendulum next to 
a mirror, the reflected version looks exactly the same as 
the original, but with one difference: when the reflection 
is at its extreme right position, the original is at its ex- 
treme left. These two states both occur in the original 
system, but there, they are separated by a time lag of ex- 
actly half the period. So the swinging pendulum has a 
kind of symmetry, in which a spatial change (reflect 
left-right) is equivalent to a temporal one (wait half a pe- 
riod). These space- time symmetries are fundamental to 
patterns in periodic systems. 

We looked for applications of our ideas, and mostly 
found them in physics. For example, they organize and 
explain a host of patterns found in a fluid confined be- 
tween two rotating cylinders. In 1985 we both went to a 
conference in Areata, in northern California. After the 
conference was over, four of us — three mathematicians 



153 



Ian Stewart 

and a physicist — shared a rented car back to San Fran- 
cisco. It was a very small car — calling it "subcompact" 
would be far too generous — and it had to hold all of our 
luggage as well as us. To make matters worse, we 
stopped off at a Napa Valley chateau so that Marty could 
pick up a crate of his favorite wine. 

Anyway, on the journey we stopped every so often to 
admire the redwoods and giant sequoias, and in between 
Marty and I worked out how our theory applied to a sys- 
tem of oscillators joined together in a ring. ("Oscillator" 
is just a word for anything that undergoes periodic be- 
havior.) We did the work entirely in our heads, not writ- 
ing anything down because there wasn't room to move. 
This exercise was mathematically pleasing, but it seemed 
rather artificial. It never occurred to us to look at biol- 
ogy instead of physics, probably because we didn't know 
any biology. 

At this point fate intervened. I was sent a book called 
Natural Computation to review for the magazine New Sci- 
entist. It was about engineers taking inspiration from na- 
ture, trying to develop computer vision by analogy with 
the eye, for instance. A couple of chapters were about 
legged locomotion: building robots with legs to move 
over rough terrain, that kind of thing. And in those 
chapters I came across a list of patterns in the movement 
of four-legged animals. 

I recognized some of the patterns: they were space- 
time symmetries, and I knew that the natural place for 



154 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

them to occur was in a ring of four oscillators. Four legs 
. . . four oscillators ... it definitely seemed promising. So 
I mentioned this curiosity in the review. 

A few days after the book review appeared in print, 
my phone rang. It was Jim Collins, then a young re- 
search student visiting Oxford University, about fifty 
miles from where I lived. He knew a lot about animal 
movement, and was intrigued by the possible mathe- 
matical connection. He came to visit for a day, we put 
our heads together ... to cut a long story short, we 
wrote a series of papers on space-time patterns in ani- 
mal locomotion. 

Many of the more radical changes of research direc- 
tion in my life have come about in similar ways: spotting 
a possible connection between some math that I already 
knew and something I happened on by accident. Every 
link of this type is a potential research program, and the 
great beauty of it is, you have a pretty good idea how to 
get started. What features are crucial to the math? How 
might similar features appear in the real-world applica- 
tion? For example, in the locomotion story, the ring of 
mathematical oscillators relates to what neuroscientists 
call a "central pattern generator." This is a circuit made 
from nerve cells that spontaneously produces the natural 
"rhythms," the space-time patterns, of locomotion. So 
Jim and I quickly realized that we were trying to model a 
central pattern generator, and that a first stab was to 
treat it as a ring of nerve cells. 



155 



Ian Stewart 



We no longer believe our original model is correct: it 
is too simple, it has a technical flaw, and something 
slightly more complicated is needed. We have a fair idea 
of what that replacement looks like. That's how research 
is: one good idea, and you're set for years. 

Read widely, keep your mind active, keep your an- 
tennae out; when they report something interesting, 
pounce. As Louis Pasteur famously said, chance favors 
the prepared mind.

How to Teach Math 



Dear Meg, 

Excellent news! Congratulations on the postdoc po- 
sition. I'm delighted, though not surprised: you deserve 
it. The research project on visual processing in fruit flies 
sounds very interesting, and it overlaps your interests 
pretty well, even if you haven't been exposed to the bio- 
logical aspects before. 

You should count it as a bonus that the position in- 
cludes some teaching duties. You'll find that teaching 
math to others improves your own understanding. But 
it's only natural to be a little nervous, and I'm not sur- 
prised that you think you are "not at all prepared" for 
your teaching responsibilities. Many people in your po- 
sition feel that way. But the nerves will vanish as soon as 
you get started. You've been in classrooms all your life, 
you've observed several dozen teachers at length, and 
you have strong opinions about what makes a course 
good or bad. All this is preparation. It's important that 



157 



Ian Stewart 



you not let a lack of confidence delude you into taking 
this part of your job too lightly. 

A good teacher, like my Mr. Radford, is worth his or 
her weight in gold. Good teachers inspire their students, 
well, some of them. Correspondingly, bad teachers can 
put students off a subject for life. Unfortunately, it is 
much easier to be a bad teacher than a good one, and 
you don't have to be really bad to have the same negative 
effect as someone who genuinely is totally awful. It is far 
easier to destroy someone's confidence than to help 
them regain it. 

Teaching matters. It's not just a boring necessity that 
pays for the excitement of research. It is your opportunity 
to pass on your understanding of math to the next genera- 
tion. Many good mathematicians enjoy their teaching, and 
work just as hard at it as they do at their research projects. 
They feel a great pride of ownership in their courses. 

It is not unusual for a research idea to occur to you 
while you are preparing a course, or teaching it, or set- 
ting a test on it. I think this happens because your mind 
moves out of its usual "research" grooves when you are 
teaching, and you start asking new questions. 

Here I must add a confession. It is now several years 
since I taught any undergraduates, because my position 
was changed in 1997 to allow more time for "public un- 
derstanding of science" activities. Instead of the usual 
fifty percent teaching, fifty percent research, it became 
fifty percent research and fifty percent public lectures, 



158 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

radio, TV, magazines, newspapers, and popular science 
books. This has had one beneficial effect: Fve been able 
to employ teaching techniques you seldom encounter in 
an undergraduate lecture. The most memorable of these 
was the day I brought a live tiger into the lecture theatre. 

I was delivering the 1997 Christmas Lectures, on 
BBC television: five hours of popular science, filmed "as 
live" before an audience of about five hundred mostly 
young people. This lecture series was initiated by 
Michael Faraday in 1826, and I was the second mathe- 
matician to take part. 

One of the five lectures was on symmetry and pattern 
formation, and I wanted to start with William Blake's 
poem — a cliche, but a good one nonetheless — whose 
opening stanza begins "Tyger! Tyger! burning bright," 
and ends with "Dare frame thy fearful symmetry. " So, 
television being what it is, we decided to bring on a real 
tiger. How we found one is a story in its own right, but 
suffice it to say, we did. Nikka was a six-month-old ti- 
gress, and she entered the lecture theatre on the end of a 
chain held by two burly young men. 

I have never heard an audience go so quiet, so 
quickly. 

Nikka's role went beyond poetic metaphor. The 
symmetry I had in mind was her stripes, especially the 
regular rings along her elegant tail. She was a true star: 
she behaved beautifully, and we got exactly the footage 
we wanted. 



159 



Ian Stewart 

I've never really been able to match that as a way to 
start a lecture. 

What I lost by way of contact with undergraduates, 
then, I gained in contact with wildlife. The Mathemat- 
ics Department didn't suffer, because it was allocated a 
replacement teaching position, but I missed my regular 
interactions with undergraduate students. I gained in 
other ways, of course; mostly, I could allocate my time 
as I wished, which was wonderful. I still supervise PhD 
students, so some of my teaching has continued, but 
you should bear in mind that some of what I say may be 
outdated. In my defense, I did teach regular undergrad- 
uate courses for twenty-eight years before that, includ- 
ing two years in the United States, so I have some 
knowledge of the American system and how it differs 
from the British. The similarities are more important 
than the differences, but Til try to translate my experi- 
ence into your context. 

To my mind, the most important feature of good 
teachers is that they put themselves in the student's po- 
sition. It's not just a matter of giving clear and accurate 
lectures and grading tests; the main objective is to help 
the student understand the material. Whether you are 
delivering a lecture or talking with students during of- 
fice hours, you have to remember that what seems per- 
fectly obvious and transparent to you may be 
mysterious and opaque to someone who has not en- 
countered the ideas before. 



160 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

I always tried to remind myself of that. When grad- 
ing tests, it is so easy to start thinking, "IVe taught them 
this stuff for twenty years now, and they still don't under- 
stand it." But each year brings new students, who en- 
counter much the same difficulties as their predecessors, 
make the same mistakes, misunderstand the same things. 
It's not their fault that you've seen it all before. 

It's actually to your advantage, Meg, that you haven't 
seen it all before. Consider yourself fortunate, and ex- 
ploit that. The students will feel comfortable with you 
because you're close to their age, you've just been 
through the same mill that is now grinding them, and 
you haven't grown bored teaching the same course sev- 
eral times. I can still remember my first few lecture 
courses vividly; teaching was easier for me then than it 
became ten years later. After a while, you know too 
much, and there's the danger that you try to pass all of 
that knowledge and insight on to the students. Big mis- 
take. They don't have the same perspective that you do. 
So the KISS principle applies: Keep It Simple, Stupid. 
Stick to the main points, and try not to digress if doing 
so requires the students to understand new ideas that are 
not in the syllabus, however fascinating and illuminating 
they may seem to you. 

The American system is more straightforward than 
the British one in this regard. Typically, there is a set text 
and an agreed syllabus — right down to page numbers 
and specific paragraphs to be included or not — so the 



161 



Ian Stewart 

content is established and everyone knows it, or should. 
But there's still room for input from the teacher, and 
there's a delicate balance between helping the students 
by putting your own stamp on the material, and confus- 
ing them by introducing too many extraneous ideas. 

So before telling them something that may be out- 
side the text, you need to ask yourself, if I were a stu- 
dent, who knew the textbook up to this particular page 
but nothing beyond, what would help me understand the 
material better? And the key step in coming up with a 
good answer to that question is to make sure you under- 
stand the material yourself. 

Let me give you an example. The details are less im- 
portant than the approach, which applies to many simi- 
lar situations. 

At some point early in your teaching career, one of 
your precalculus students is going to ask you why "mi- 
nus times minus gives plus." For instance, (—3) x (—5) 
= +15, not — 15. And even though this topic should have 
been beaten to death in high school, you are going to 
have to justify the standard mathematical convention. 

The first thing is to admit that it is a convention. It 
may be the only choice that makes sense, but mathe- 
maticians could, if they wished, have insisted that (—3) x 
(—5) = —15. The concept of multiplication would then 
have been different, and the usual laws of algebra would 
have been torn to shreds and thrown out the window, 
but hey! Old words often take on new meanings in new 



162 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

contexts, and there is nothing sacred about the laws of 
algebra. 

There are two reasons why the standard convention is 
a good one: an external reason, to do with how mathemat- 
ics models reality, and an internal one, to do with elegance. 

The external reason convinces a lot of students. 
Think of numbers as representing money in the bank, 
with positive numbers being money you possess and 
negative numbers being debts to the bank. Thus — 5 is a 
debt of $5, so 3 x (-5) is three debts of $5, which clearly 
amount to a total debt of $15. So 3 x (—5) = —15, and 
no one seems bothered much about that. But what of 
(—3) x (—5)? This is what you get when the bank for- 
gives 3 debts of $5. If it does that, you gain $15. So 
(-3)x(-5) = +15. 

The only other choice any students ever advocate is 
— 15, but that would leave you in debt. 

The "internal" explanation is to work out a sum like 
(—3) x (5 — 5). On the one hand, this is clearly zero. On 
the other, we can use the laws of algebra to expand it, get- 
ting (— 3) x 5 + (— 3) x (—5). Since we've already agreed 
that minus times plus is minus, we deduce that consistency 
of the laws of algebra requires —15 + (— 3) x (— 5) = 0, 
which implies that (— 3) x (— 5) = 15 (add 15 to each side). 

The most we can assert in the first case is that if we 
want the math to model bank accounts, then minus 
times minus has to work out as plus. The most we can 
assert in the second case is that if we want the usual laws 



163 



Ian Stewart 

of algebra to hold for negative numbers, then the same 
goes. There is nothing requiring either of these things to 
be true. But it will certainly be more convenient if they 
are, and that is why mathematicians chose that particular 
convention. 

I'm sure you can think of other, similar arguments. 
The important thing is not to say to the student, "That's 
how it is. Don't question it, just learn it." But to my 
mind it would be even worse to leave them with the im- 
pression that there was never any choice to be made, 
that it is somehow ordained that minus times minus 
makes plus. All of those concepts — plus, minus, times — 
are human inventions. 

At this point one of your more thoughtful students 
may remark that it is ordained, in the sense that there 
exists only one system of mathematics that proceeds 
from the counting numbers in a completely consistent 
way. You can respond that actually there are several ex- 
tensions of the number concept — negative numbers, 
fractions, "real" numbers (infinite decimals), "complex" 
numbers in which — 1 has a square root . . . even quater- 
nions (in which — 1 has many square roots but some 
laws of algebra fail). Each of these extensions is prov- 
ably unique, subject to possessing certain features, but it 
is up to human beings to choose which features they 
consider significant. It would, for example, be possible 
to invent a new number system in which all negative 
numbers are equal, and it would be entirely consistent 



164 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

from a logical point of view. But it would not obey the 
usual rules of algebra. 

You can concede, if pushed, that some extensions 
seem to be more natural than others. 

Discussions of this kind do not always work; in- 
grained misconceptions can be hard to eradicate. Even if 
they do work, you need to show your students where 
their intuition is going wrong. 

Typically, when a student gets stuck at some point in 
the syllabus, the real problem lies elsewhere, some pages 
or courses or years back. Perhaps they don't understand 
the relation between multiplication and repeated addi- 
tion. Perhaps they understand it only too well, and can't 
see how you can add minus three lots of — 5 together. 
It's amazing how often teaching reveals hidden assump- 
tions or unquestioned features of your own mathemati- 
cal background. Whenever an existing mathematical 
concept is extended into a new domain, you have to 
abandon some of its previous interpretations and accept 
new ones. 

You can survive new material in mathematics for 
quite a while without taking it fully onboard. My col- 
league David Tall has a theory about this, which I rather 
like. His idea is that mathematics advances by (conceptu- 
ally) turning processes into things. For instance, "num- 
ber" starts out as the process of counting. The number 5 
is where you get to when you count the fingers (by 
which we'll include the thumb) of one hand: "One, two, 



165 



Ian Stewart 

three, four, five." But in order to make progress, at some 
stage you have to stop going through the process of 
counting, and think of 5 as a thing in its own right. This 
is already useful when you start doing sums like 5 + 3. 
But students can cover up their inability to turn count- 
ing into a thing by lining up the fingers of one hand with 
three fingers of the other, and then counting the lot: 
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" 

This cover-up can go undetected for a long time, but 
it falls down in the face of sums like 2546 + 9773. 

Multiplication affords another example. For a time, 
you can think of, say, 4 x 5 as 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 and fall 
back on your understanding of addition (even using 
counting). But when faced with 444 x 555, you need 
something more sophisticated. 

The interesting thing is that the strategies that fail in 
the long term are precisely the ones that we use to teach 
these new concepts in the short term. We relate num- 
bers to counting, often using real "counters." We relate 
multiplication to repeated addition. There's nothing 
wrong with this. Mathematics builds new ideas on old 
ones. It's hard to see how else you could teach it. But 
eventually the training wheels have to come off the bike: 
students have to internalize the new idea. 

David calls these process-cum-concepts "procepts." 
A procept can sometimes be usefully viewed as a process, 
and other times as a concept, a thing. The art of mathe- 
matics involves switching effortlessly from one of those 



166 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

viewpoints to the other. When you're doing your re- 
search, you don't even notice the switch. But when 
you're teaching, you have to be aware of it. If one of 
your students is having trouble with a new procept, the 
cause may be a past failure to "proceptualize" one of the 
processes involved. So your job as a teacher is to back- 
track through the series of ideas that leads up to the new 
one. You're not looking for the first place where your 
student fails to answer a question. You're looking for the 
first place where they can answer it only by using some 
simpler idea as a crutch. 

In British elementary schools, the educational estab- 
lishment has managed to get this spectacularly wrong. 
We now have a highly prescriptive "national curricu- 
lum," and teachers — quite literally — check hundreds of 
boxes to mark the student's progress. Can they count to 
five? Check. Can they add five to three? Check. The as- 
sumption is that what matters is their ability to get the 
answer. But what really matters is how they get the an- 
swer. I'm old-fashioned enough to believe that either 
way they have to get the right answer; no easy grades for 
"method" from me. But I am absolutely certain that 
checking a series of boxes is not the way to teach anyone 
mathematics.

The Mathematical Community 



Dear Meg, 

Now that you are on the verge of becoming a fully 
fledged member of the mathematical community, it's a 
good idea to understand what that entails. Not just the 
professional aspects, which we've already discussed, but 
the people you will be working alongside, and how you 
will fit in. 

There's a saying in science fiction circles: "It is a 
proud and lonely thing to be a fan." The rest of the 
world cannot appreciate your enthusiasm for what seems 
to them a bizarre and pointless activity. The word 
"nerd" comes to mind. But we are all nerds about some- 
thing, unless we are couch potatoes who have no inter- 
ests except what's on TV. Mathematicians are passionate 
about their subject, and proud to belong to a mathemat- 
ical community whose tentacles stretch far and wide. 
You will find that community to be a constant source of 
encouragement and support — not to mention criticism 



168 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

and advice. Yes, there will be disagreements too, but 
generally speaking, mathematicians are friendly and re- 
laxed, provided you avoid pushing the wrong buttons. 

Pride is one thing, loneliness another. My experience 
is that today's public is much more aware than it used to 
be that mathematicians do useful and interesting things. 
At parties, if you admit to being one, you are far more 
likely to be asked, "What do you think about chaos the- 
ory?" than be told, "I was never any good at math when I 
was at school." In Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton says 
that today's mathematicians no longer resemble ac- 
countants, and some are more like rock stars. 

If so, this is very bad news for rock stars. 

Even if people ask you about chaos theory at parties, 
it is still unwise to explain your latest theorem on semi- 
continuous pseudometrics on Kahler manifolds to the 
guy in a leather jacket. (Though nowadays he might 
turn out to be a mathematician. But don't count on it.) 
So, despite the public's newfound tolerance of math, 
there will be occasions when you want to be with people 
who understand where you're coming from. Such as just 
after you've finally proved the semicontinuous case of 
the Roddick-Federer conjecture on the irregularity of 
Kahler manifold pseudometrics in dimensions greater 
than 34. 

Science fiction fans go to conventions ("cons," as 
they say) to talk to other science fiction fans. Whippet 
breeders go to whippet shows and compete with other 



169 



Ian Stewart 

people who breed whippets. Mathematicians go to con- 
ferences to hang out with other mathematicians. Or they 
give seminars, or colloquia, or just visit. 

Our first vice chancellor, Jack Butterworth, once said 
that no university was worth anything unless a quarter 
of its faculty was in the air. He intended this literally: 
air travel, not intellectual high flight. The best way to 
advance the cause of mathematics is to meet other 
mathematicians. 

If you are lucky, they will come to you. The Univer- 
sity of Warwick, founded in the 1960s, became a world- 
class center for mathematics because from day one it 
held symposia, year-long special programs in some area 
of math. (I was once told that "symposium" means 
"drinking together," a theory that cannot be rejected out 
of hand.) But it's a good idea, and more fun, if you go to 
them. Mathematics, like all the sciences, has always been 
international. Isaac Newton used to write to his counter- 
parts in France and Germany, but today he could hop on 
a budget flight and meet them. 

Mathematicians get together, usually over coffee; 
Erd6s said that a mathematician is a machine for turning 
coffee into theorems. They share jokes, gossip, theo- 
rems, and news. 

The jokes are mathematical, of course. There is a 
lengthy compendium of classic mathematical jokes in 
the January 2005 issue of the Notices of the American 
Mathematical Society, and its contents are a vital part of 



170 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

your mathematical culture, Meg. There is, for instance, 
a Noah's ark joke. (Actually, my favorite Noah's ark joke 
is biological: a cartoon. The rain is coming down in 
sheets, the ark is loaded with two of every kind of ani- 
mal, and Noah is on hands and knees grubbing around 
in the mud. Mrs. Noah is shouting from the ark, "Noah! 
Forget the other amoeba!") Anyway, the mathematical 
Noah's ark joke goes like this: 

The Flood has receded and the ark is safely aground 
atop Mount Ararat; Noah tells all the animals to go forth 
and multiply. Soon the land is teeming with every kind 
of living creature in abundance, except for snakes. Noah 
wonders why. One morning two miserable snakes knock 
on the door of the ark with a complaint. "You haven't cut 
down any trees." Noah is puzzled, but does as they wish. 
Within a month, you can't walk a step without treading 
on baby snakes. With difficulty, he tracks down the two 
parents. "What was all that with the trees?" "Ah," says 
one of the snakes, "you didn't notice which species we 
are." Noah still looks blank. "We're adders, and we can 
only multiply using logs." 

This joke is a multiple pun: you can multiply num- 
bers by adding their logarithms. Other jokes parody the 
logic of proofs: "Theorem: A cat has nine tails. Proof. No 
cat has eight tails. A cat has one more tail than no cat. 
QED." 

Mathematicians tell each other theorems. Quirky 
ones, like the "ham sandwich theorem": if you have a 



171 



Ian Stewart 



slice of ham and two slices of bread, arranged in space in 
any relative positions whatsoever, then there exists a 
plane dividing each of the three pieces exactly in half. Or 
the recently proved "bellows conjecture," which says 
that if a polyhedron flexes (as, remarkably, some can), 
then its volume doesn't change. But there is often a sting 
in the tail: "Proved that? OK, now do it with n objects in 
n dimensions." Sometimes they tell each other conjec- 
tures, theorems not yet proved and that for all they 
know might be false. My favorite is the "sausage conjec- 
ture." For starters, suppose you want to wrap a number 
of tennis balls in plastic film. What arrangement has the 
least surface area? (Assume that the film forms a convex 
surface: no dents.) The answer is that if you have fifty-six 
balls or fewer, they should be placed in a line to make a 
"sausage." If you have fifty-seven or more, then they 
should be clumped together more like potatoes in a 
string bag. 

In a four-dimensional analogue, the breakpoint is 
somewhere between fifty thousand and one hundred 
thousand. With fifty thousand balls they form a sausage. 
With one hundred thousand they clump. The exact 
breakpoint here is not known. 

Here is the full conjecture: Three and four dimen- 
sions are misleading. Prove that in five or more dimen- 
sions, sausages are always the answer, no matter how 
large the number of balls may be. 



172 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

The sausage conjecture has been proved in forty- two 
dimensions or more. 

This is bizarre. I love it. 

There will be gossip. Nowadays it may be about the 
topologist who ran off with her secretary, or the messy 
divorce of two well-known group theorists, but that's a 
recent development that I trace to the bad influence of 
television. Traditionally, gossip is about who is in line 
for the Chair of Abstract Nonsense at Boondoggle Uni- 
versity, or do you know anyone who has a postdoc posi- 
tion going for a young functional analyst like my 
student Kylie, or do you think Winkle and Whelk's pur- 
ported proof of the mass gap hypothesis has any chance 
of being right? 

There will be serious news. As I write, a major topic of 
conversation is the latest information on Grisha Perel- 
man's alleged proof of the Poincare conjecture. Has any- 
one found a hole in it yet? What do the experts think 
today? This is really exciting because the Poincare conjec- 
ture is one of the great open questions in mathematics, 
second only to the Riemann hypothesis. It all went back 
to a mistake that Henri Poincare made in 1900. He as- 
sumed without proof that any three-dimensional topolog- 
ical space (with some technical conditions) in which every 
loop can be continuously shrunk to a single point must be 
equivalent to a three-sphere, the three-dimensional ana- 
logue of the two-dimensional surface of an ordinary 



173 



Ian Stewart 

sphere. Then he noticed the absence of any proof, tried 
to find one, and failed. He turned the failure into a ques- 
tion: is every such space a three-sphere? But everyone 
was so sure that the answer had to be yes that his ques- 
tion quietly turned into a conjecture. Its generalization to 
higher dimensions was then proved, for every dimension 
except 3, which was disappointing, to say the least. The 
Poincare conjecture became so notorious that it is now 
one of the seven millennium problems selected by the 
Clay Institute as the most important open questions in 
mathematics. Each problem carries a million-dollar re- 
ward for its solution. 

In 2002 and 2003 Perelman, a rather diffident young 
Russian with a physics background, published two pa- 
pers on the arXiv ("archive"), a website for mathematical 
preprints, with the offhand remark that they not only 
proved the Poincare conjecture, they also proved the 
even more powerful Thurston geometrization conjec- 
ture, which holds the key to all three-dimensional topo- 
logical spaces! 

Usually this kind of claim turns out to be nonsense, 
but Perelman's idea is clever and comes with a good 
pedigree. His trick is to use the so-called Ricci flow to 
deform the candidate space in a manner closely analo- 
gous to how space-time deforms under Einstein's equa- 
tions of general relativity. And that's the snag. To 
understand the proof properly, you need to know three- 
dimensional topology, relativity, cosmology, and a dozen 



174 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

other hitherto unconnected areas of pure math and 
mathematical physics. And it's a long and difficult proof, 
with plenty of traps for the unwary. Moreover, Perelman 
followed the time-honored Russian tradition of not giv- 
ing all the details. So the experts, who have been work- 
ing through his ideas in seminars all over the world, are 
understandably wary of declaring the proof correct. But 
every time someone finds what might be a gap or a mis- 
take, Perelman quietly explains that he's already thought 
of that and why it isn't a problem. And he's right. 

It's gotten to the point where, even if the proof turns 
out to be wrong, the correct things achieved along the 
way are of major significance to mathematics. And as I 
write, the experts seem to be nudging ever closer to the 
view that the proof really does work. Keep your ears 
open over the coffee, Meg. 

As your career develops, the worldwide mathematical 
community will be increasingly important to you. You 
will become part of it, and then you will have a home in 
every city on Earth. 

Just arrived in Tokyo? Drop by the nearest university, 
find the math department, walk in. There will be at least 
one person you know, or who knows you by your work 
even if you've not met before. They will drop every- 
thing, call their baby-sitter, and take you out on the town 
for the evening. They may have a spare room, if you for- 
got to book a hotel. They will set up a seminar so that you 
can present your latest ideas to a sympathetic audience. 



175 



Ian Stewart 

They may even be able to drum up a small financial con- 
tribution to your airfare. 

You don't get to fly business class, though. Or to 
sleep in a hotel suite. (Not yours, at least.) Math operates 
on the cheap and cheerful principle. I sometimes wish 
we didn't undervalue ourselves in this manner, but it's in- 
grained habit and it is far too late to change it. 

It is of course more civilized and more organized to 
e-mail the University of Tokyo math department in ad- 
vance. The result will be similar. 

If you get on well with your host, they will invite you 
back. As you and they climb the career ladder, both of 
you will start being invited to conferences. Then you 
will find yourself organizing conferences, which means 
that you can invite everyone you want to talk to. There 
is some kind of "phase transition," so that over a period 
of about a year, you will go from being invited to no 
conferences to being invited to far too many. Be selec- 
tive; learn to say no. Learn sometimes to say yes. 

There are big conferences and medium-sized confer- 
ences and small conferences. There are special confer- 
ences and general ones. The big, general ones are great 
for meeting people and trawling for jobs. Every four 
years, the International Congress of Mathematicians is 
held somewhere in the world. I last went when it was in 
Kyoto, and there were four thousand participants. I saw a 
lot of Kyoto, met lots of old friends and made some new 
ones, and learned a little bit about what people outside 



176 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

my area were doing. The family came too, and they had a 
whale of a time exploring the city and its surroundings. 

I much prefer smallish, specialized meetings with a 
specific research theme. You can learn a lot from those, 
because almost every talk is on something that interests 
you and is related to what you are working on at the mo- 
ment. And once you've been in the business for a few 
years, you will know almost everyone else who is attend- 
ing. Except for the youngest participants, who have only 
just joined the community. 

Welcome, Meg.

Pigs and Pickup Trucks 



Dear Meg, 

Assistant Professor, indeed. I'm proud of you; we all 
are. At an excellent institution, too. You're a professional 
mathematician now, with professional obligations. And 
it occurs to me that I've been so busy offering advice 
about what to do in various circumstances that I've left 
out the other side of the equation: what not to do. Now 
that you have a tenure-track position, you will be taking 
on more responsibility, so you will have more to lose if 
you foul up. There are plenty of ways for mathemati- 
cians to make complete idiots of themselves in public, 
and nearly all of us have managed it at some stage in our 
careers. People make mistakes; wise people learn from 
them. And the least painful way is to learn from mistakes 
made by others. 

The longer you stay in the business of mathematics, 
the more blunders you will inevitably make; this is how 
experienced people gain their experience. I have wit- 



178 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

nessed, and committed, plenty of mistakes myself. They 
can range from writing the wrong equation on the board 
to mortally insulting the president of your university at 
some significant public event. Be warned. You will no 
doubt invent some new mistakes of your own; occasional 
embarrassment is the natural human condition. 

Most of my advice will be obvious. An assistant pro- 
fessor who wishes to be tenured at her university must 
find out what the requirements and expectations are, and 
then meet them. If you are expected to have published 
two papers beyond the subject of your dissertation and 
instead publish one paper, coach the math club, direct 
the study-abroad program in Budapest, obtain a major 
research grant, and win the teacher-of-the-decade prize, 
you may be denied tenure. Take care to be polite to your 
superiors, unless you have excellent reasons not to and 
want to change jobs. Be polite to everyone else, when 
they deserve it and even sometimes when they don't. If 
you disagree with some decision or argument, make 
your point concisely, clearly, and without implying that 
the opposing view is insane, even when it is. Honor your 
commitments, whether they are tutorial sessions, office 
hours, examination grading, or plenary lectures at the 
International Congress of Mathematicians. If you agree 
to sit on a committee, turn up for its meetings. Listen to 
the discussion. Contribute, though not at length. Gener- 
ally, remember that you are a professional, and behave 
like one. 



179 



Ian Stewart 



Some mistakes, on the other hand, are obvious only 
after you've made them. There is a persistent story at 
Warwick University that I ended my first ever under- 
graduate lecture by walking into the broom cupboard. It 
is time to set the record straight. Yes, I admit that it was a 
broom cupboard, but it was also the emergency exit 
from the lecture hall. I had assumed, without finding out 
ahead of time, that when the students left the hall by the 
main doors, I would be able to leave by what looked like 
a side door. But when I tried it, I found myself sur- 
rounded by buckets and mops. Worse, I discovered that 
the only way to leave the building by that route was to 
push open an emergency exit, which would set off an 
alarm. I had noticed the EXIT sign over the door but 
had failed to spot the word "emergency" above it. So I 
was forced, rather sheepishly, to emerge from the so- 
called broom cupboard and join the students as they 
walked up the stairs to the back of the hall and out the 
main doors. 

The message here is, don't assume things. Check 
them beforehand. Not just the layout of the lecture hall 
or the location of the building where you are supposed 
to be giving a talk, or the city in which your meeting is 
due to take place, or the date of that meeting . . . Recall 
Murphy's law: "Anything that can go wrong, will." 
Above all, remember the mathematician's corollary to 
Murphy's law: "Anything that can't go wrong will go 
wrong too.

Letters to a Young Mathematician 

This was brought home very clearly to a good friend 
of mine, also a mathematician, on a trip to a country 
that it would be best not to name. He was attending a 
conference and he was making a flight from his first 
port of entry to another, fairly distant, city. As he sat in 
the airplane scribbling some calculations, he noticed the 
pilot emerge from the flight cabin, shutting the con- 
necting door behind him. A few minutes later the copi- 
lot did the same thing. Soon after that, the pilot 
returned, and tried to open the door to return to the 
cockpit. He seemed to be encountering some difficulty. 
The copilot tried to help, but neither of them could 
open the door. At this point my friend realized that the 
plane was flying on autopilot and no one could get to 
the controls. A female flight attendant joined the pilot 
and copilot, disappeared, and reappeared carrying a 
small hand ax. The pilot then attacked the door with the 
ax, made a hole in it, put his hand through, and opened 
the door. The flight crew then entered the cabin and 
closed the door behind them. 

No announcement was made to explain these events 
to the bemused and distincdy frightened passengers. 

My advice here really applies to the pilot and the copi- 
lot, not the passengers. If you go to conferences, you will 
sometimes have to fly on airlines that have been booked 
by the conference organizers. You can choose not to go, if 
you wish, but you can't always choose not to travel on an 
airline with a dubious safety record or an aging fleet. 



181 



Ian Stewart 



There really is no way for a passenger to anticipate such a 
problem, or to help solve it or avoid it. 

Let me revert to the topic of lecturing. Another use- 
ful piece of advice is to make sure that you have plenty of 
time to get to the lecture room. Avoid taking on unpre- 
dictable commitments immediately beforehand. I still 
have vivid recollections of arriving late to give a lecture 
on algebra. I lived in a village at that time, and another 
member of the math department owned a small farm in 
the same village, so we carpooled. One day when it was 
his turn to drive, he decided to drop a pig off at the local 
abattoir on the way to work. The pig, perhaps sensing 
that the trip would not be to its advantage, had other 
ideas. It refused to climb the plank into the back of the 
truck. It is difficult to remain professorial when explain- 
ing that you were late because you could not get a pig 
into a pickup truck. 

One of the main ways you will interact with other 
mathematicians is by attending, and giving, talks. These 
might be seminars, specialist talks for experts in your re- 
search area; they might be colloquia, more general talks 
for professional mathematicians but not specialists in the 
area concerned; or they might be public lectures open to 
anyone who wants to turn up. All lectures are fraught 
with potential disaster. 

There was, for instance, a prominent professor of 
number theory who had the habit of turning up at the 
start of a visiting speaker's seminar, falling asleep within 



182 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

minutes of the talk starting, snoring loudly the whole 
way through, and then asking penetrating questions at 
the end when the audience's applause woke him up. By 
all means, emulate the penetrating questions, but try to 
avoid the snoring if you possibly can; otherwise you will 
get a reputation for eccentricity. 

If you are the person giving the talk, the opportuni- 
ties for Murphy to strike are far more numerous, espe- 
cially if you are using equipment. When I started 
lecturing, the only equipment we ever had was black- 
board and chalk, and I confess to a continuing bias in fa- 
vor of lo-tech visual aids, though I am capable of 
preparing the all-singing, all-dancing PowerPoint pre- 
sentation with a video projector and moving graphics 
downloaded from the Internet if that is what is called for. 
I have used overhead projectors, whiteboards with those 
horrible pens that smell of solvent, even the businessper- 
son's ubiquitous flipchart. 

Even chalk can go wrong. First, it may not be there. I 
developed a habit of taking my own box of chalk to lec- 
tures in case the previous lecturer had used it all, or the 
students had hidden it as a joke. Some chalk is very dusty 
and gets all over your clothes: I made sure I had the "an- 
tidust" kind with me. It still got on my clothes, but the 
cleaning bills were smaller. Many types of chalk can make 
horrible screeching sounds when you write, putting 
everyone's teeth on edge. It takes practice to prevent that. 
And normal-sized chalk will not do if you are lecturing to 



183 



Ian Stewart 

five hundred freshman calculus students in a cavernous 
lecture hall. You need supersize. 

Other types of equipment can go wrong more spectac- 
ularly. A good friend of mine was delivering a short talk at 
the British Mathematical Colloquium — the UK's main 
mathematics conference, held annually — and he was in- 
tending to use an overhead projector to show lots of pic- 
tures on a projection screen. Unfortunately, when he tried 
to pull the screen down from the ceiling — it was on a 
roller and there was a string attached — it fell down on his 
head. He ended up projecting the pictures onto the wall. 

Never believe your hosts when they tell you that all 
the equipment will work perfectly. Always try it for 
yourself before the lecture. I was giving a public lecture 
in Warsaw using a cassette of about eighty 35-mm slides. 
I was persuaded to hand the slides to the projectionist, 
who would set everything up for me, while my hosts 
took me for a quick coffee. As I entered the room to de- 
liver the lecture, the projectionist put the slides into the 
projector, which was tilted at an alarming angle because 
of the high position of the screen. The cassette slid right 
through the projector and fell out the back onto the 
floor, where its contents were scattered far and wide. 
Many of the slides were sandwiched between thin sheets 
of glass, which broke. It took ten minutes to get every- 
thing back into some kind of order, in front of five hun- 
dred patient people. 



184 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

Do not confuse the projection screen with a white- 
board and write on it in permanent ink. Many people do 
this, and their lecture is preserved for eternity, along 
with their mistake. 

The famous physicist Richard Feynman once learned 
Spanish because he was going to give a lecture in Brazil. 
Check the local language. 

If you are hosting a visitor, and they are giving a talk, 
make sure that you have the key to the projection room. 
On one occasion I had to improvise my lecture because 
the slide projector, though visible to us all inside a won- 
derfully equipped room, might as well have been located 
on the moon because the room was locked and no one 
knew how to get the key. 

Do not forget that your visitor may not know the lo- 
cal geography. I was once abandoned inside a Dutch 
mathematics department building when my hosts went 
off to the parking garage to go to a restaurant. I had to 
make my escape through a window, setting off a burglar 
alarm. I did manage to catch up with them in the garage, 
which was a good thing because I had no idea where the 
restaurant was, or even what its name was. 

Avoid wandering around strange buildings, especially 
in the dark. A biologist friend was visiting an institution 
with a strong marine biology department, and it had an 
aquarium. The entrance was down a short flight of stairs. 
Alone in the building, late at night, he tried to enter the 



185 



Ian Stewart 

pitch-black room, felt for the light switch, and acciden- 
tally hit the fire alarm instead. 

Six fire engines turned up, lights blazing, sirens 
blaring. 

He had called the fire station to explain his mistake, 
but according to the rules, they could not return to base 
without checking for a fire. 

Committees are another place where you can easily 
make dreadful mistakes. Universities tend to run as a 
network of interlocking committees and subcommittees, 
some with real teeth, some window dressing. Most exist 
for a reason, and many tackle low-level but essential ac- 
tivities such as grading tests or sorting out course regula- 
tions. You will undoubtedly be involved in committee 
work, and you should be. A university is a complicated 
place, and it will not function well if everyone is left to 
make things up as they go along. Every academic has to 
be something of an administrator, and to some extent 
the converse holds, especially at senior levels. 

Not being a committee animal myself, I can't offer 
much useful advice on how to "work" a committee so 
that it reaches the decision you favor. But I do know how 
not to. The following story is typical. An important 
committee was debating a major decision about some 
particular action. The mathematician on the committee 
saw immediately that taking the action concerned would 
lead to disaster, and spent five minutes explaining the 
logic behind this view, which was unassailable. His 



186 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

analysis was clear and concise, and left no real room to 
doubt his conclusions; no one contradicted him. The de- 
bate continued, however, because the other members of 
the committee had not yet had their say. After an hour or 
more of farther discussion — to which the mathematician 
did not contribute, having already (he assumed) made 
his point — the committee voted. It decided to take pre- 
cisely the action that the mathematician had warned it 
not to. 

What was his mistake? It was not in the analysis, nor 
in its presentation, but in its timing. In any committee 
discussion, there comes a pivotal moment when the de- 
cision can be swayed either way. That is the time to 
strike. If you make your point too soon, everyone else 
will have forgotten it; if you are lucky, you may be able 
to remedy this with a timely reminder. But if you make 
your point too late, there is no way it can have any effect. 

The other thing not to do in committees is to keep 
making your point when you have already won it. You may 
lose support merely because you keep banging on about 
what has by now become obvious to everyone. If you have 
further ammunition, save it in case it is needed later. 

Which advice I will now take myself.

¦ Pleasures and Perils of 
Collaboration 



Dear Meg, 

Yes, it is a bit of a dilemma. Tenure and promotion de- 
pend on your own personal record of teaching and re- 
search, but there are attractions in working with others as 
part of a team. Fortunately, the advantages of collaborative 
research are becoming widely recognized, and any contri- 
bution that you make to a team effort will be recognized 
too. So I think you should focus on doing the best research 
you can, and if that leads you to join a team, so be it. If the 
research is good, and your teaching record is up to scratch, 
then promotion will follow, and it won't matter whether 
you did the work on your own or as part of a joint effort. In 
fact, collaboration has definite advantages; for instance, it's 
a very effective way to get experience in writing grant pro- 
posals and managing grants. You can start out as a junior 
member of someone else's team, and before long you will

Attitudes are changing, fast. In the past, mathematics 
was mostly a solo activity. The great theorems were dis- 
covered and proved by one person, working alone. To be 
sure, their work was carried out alongside that of other 
(equally solitary) mathematicians, but collaborations 
were rare and papers by three or more people were vir- 
tually nonexistent. Today, it is entirely normal to find 
papers written by three or four mathematicians. Some- 
thing close to ninety-eight percent of my research in the 
last twenty years has been collaborative; my record is a 
paper with nine authors. 

This is small potatoes compared to other branches of 
science. Some physics papers have well over a hundred 
authors, as do some papers in biology. The growth of 
collaboration has sometimes been derided as an adapta- 
tion to the "publish or perish" mentality, whereby tenure 
and promotion are determined by how many papers 
someone has published in a given period of time. An 
easy way to increase your list of publications is to get 
yourself added to somebody else's paper, and the pay- 
back is simple: you add them to yours. 

But I really don't think this tit-for-tat behavior is re- 
sponsible, to any significant degree, for the growth of 
coauthorship. 

The reason for the huge cast of authors on some 
physics papers is straightforward. In fundamental parti- 
cle physics, the joint work of a huge team, carried out 
over several years, is typically condensed into a paper of 



189 



Ian Stewart 

perhaps four journal pages. The team will include theo- 
rists, programmers, experts in the construction of parti- 
cle detectors, experts in pattern recognition algorithms 
that interpret the extremely complex data obtained by 
the detectors, engineers who know how to construct 
low-temperature electromagnets, and many others. All 
of them are vital to the enterprise; all fully deserve 
recognition as authors of the resulting report. But the 
report is usually short and to the point. "We have de- 
tected the omega-minus particle predicted by theory: 
here is the evidence." Someone may get a Nobel Prize 
for those four pages. Probably whoever is listed first. 

Big science involves big numbers of people. The 
same goes for gigantic biology projects such as genome 
sequencing. 

Something similar has been going on throughout sci- 
ence. The root cause is that science and mathematics 
have become increasingly interdisciplinary. For example, 
you'll recall that one area of interest to me is the applica- 
tion of dynamics to animal movement, and my early pa- 
pers were all written in collaboration with Jim Collins, 
an expert in biomechanics. They had to be: I didn't 
know enough about animal locomotion and Jim wasn't 
familiar with the relevant mathematics. 

My nine-author paper summed up two three-year 
projects to apply new methods of data analysis to the 
spring and wire industries. More than thirty people were 
involved in this work; for publication we reduced the list 



190 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

of authors to those who had been directly responsible for 
a significant aspect of the results. Some of us worked on 
theoretical aspects of the mathematics; some worked out 
new ways to extract what we needed from the data we 
could record; others carried out the analysis of those 
data. Our engineers designed and built test equipment; 
our programmers wrote code so that a computer could 
perform the necessary analysis in real time. Interdiscipli- 
nary projects are like that. 

For the last twenty years, funding bodies worldwide 
have advocated the growth of interdisciplinary research, 
and rightly so, because this is where many of the big ad- 
vances are being made, and will continue to be made. At 
first they didn't get it quite right. The idea of interdisci- 
plinary research was praised, but whenever anyone put 
in a proposal for such work, it went to the existing single- 
discipline committees, who of course did not understand 
substantial parts of the grant application. For example, a 
proposal to apply nonlinear dynamics to evolutionary 
biology would be turned down by the mathematics com- 
mittee because they and their referees had no expertise 
in evolution, and then it would be rejected by the biol- 
ogy committee because they didn't understand the math. 
The result was that the funding agencies encouraged 
interdisciplinary research in every way except kicking 
in funds. 

No one, mind you, was doing anything wrong. It was 
virtually impossible to justify a decision to spend money 



191 



Ian Stewart 



on the dynamics of evolution when that took money 
away from top-class projects about algebraic topology or 
protein folding, say. To the credit of those involved, the 
system has changed, for the better, and one can now ob- 
tain funding for science and math that straddles several 
disciplines. An important consequence is the creation of 
entirely new disciplines, such as biomathematics and 
computational cosmology. Another is the blurring of 
traditional subject boundaries. 

Setting these political factors aside, there is another 
reason why collaborative publication has increased dra- 
matically. A social reason. Working in groups, with col- 
leagues, is a lot more fun than sitting in your office with 
your computer. To be sure, sometimes you need soli- 
tude, to sort out a conceptual problem, formulate a defi- 
nition, carry out a calculation. But you also need the 
stimulus of discussions with others in your own area, or 
in areas where you wish to apply your ideas. Other 
people know things that you don't. More interestingly, 
when two people put their heads together, they some- 
times come up with ideas that neither of them could 
have had on their own. There is a synergy, a new synthe- 
sis, something that Jack Cohen and I like to call complic- 
ity. When two points of view complement each other, 
they don't just fit together like lock and key or strawber- 
ries and cream; they spawn completely new ideas. As 
your career progresses, you may well come to appreciate 
the delights of collaboration, and value the help, inter- 



192 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

est, and support of colleagues whose minds complement 
your own. 

Unfortunately, there can sometimes be a downside to 
collaboration. Choosing the wrong collaborator is a 
surefire recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, this can hap- 
pen with entirely reasonable and competent people; it's a 
matter of personal "chemistry," and not always easy to 
predict. The main thing is to be aware of the possibility, 
and to leave yourself an exit strategy. 

Some years ago two mathematicians that I know 
were coauthoring a book. They had no trouble agreeing 
on the mathematical content, or the order in which the 
material was presented. They just couldn't agree on the 
punctuation. It got to a stage where one of them would 
go through the entire manuscript putting in commas, 
and then the other would take them all out again. And 
round and round it went. The book did get written, but 
they have never collaborated on another one. They re- 
main the best of friends, though. 

Everyone involved in a collaboration must bring 
something useful to it. They don't have to do the same 
amount of work; one person may be the only one who 
knows how to do a big calculation, or write a compli- 
cated program for the computer, while another may 
contribute a crucial idea that ends up as two lines in the 
middle of a proof. As long as everyone contributes 
something essential, that's fair. No one objects to all 
coauthors getting some of the credit for the final result. 



193 



Ian Stewart 

But if one of the participants is just along for the ride, 
which occasionally happens, then it makes everyone 
else happier if their name does not appear on the final 
paper, book, or report. And it often makes the person 
concerned happier, too. This need not be a sign of lazi- 
ness; sometimes the project changes direction in a way 
that could not have been anticipated, and a contribu- 
tion that originally looked essential may turn out not to 
be needed. 

In big science, where huge teams are involved, the 
project plan usually stays fairly rigid and people drop out 
only if they leave and are replaced. But mathematical 
collaborations tend to be loose and spontaneous, and if 
there is a project plan, the first item on the list is to be 
ready to change the plan. 

It helps a lot to be relaxed and tolerant. That doesn't 
prevent arguments; quite the contrary. The best of 
friends can have long, loud, and emotionally heated dis- 
putes during a research project. Psychologists now think 
that the rational part of our brain rests on the emotional 
part: you have to be emotionally committed to rational 
thinking before you can think rationally. With some of 
my collaborators, neither of us feels the project is get- 
ting anywhere unless we have a shouting match every so 
often. But the shouting stops as soon as we both sort out 
who is right, and there is no residual resentment. We are 
relaxed about having an argument; we are not so relaxed 
that arguments do not happen. 



194 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

Never enter into a collaboration merely because you 
have been convinced that you should. Unless you are 
genuinely interested in working with someone, don't. It 
doesn't matter how big an expert they are, or how much 
grant money the project would bring in. Stay away from 
things that do not interest you. 

On the other hand, I do find that it pays to have 
broad interests. That way, the list of things you should 
stay away from is much smaller. I once had a fascinating 
lunch with a medievalist who was an expert on the use of 
commas in the Middle Ages. Nothing came of that in- 
teraction, but it does occur to me that my two friends 
might have benefited from his presence on their book- 
writing team.

Is God a Mathematician? 



Dear Meg, 

It was very good to see you in San Diego last month. 
I'm ashamed to say I'd rather lost touch with your par- 
ents since they moved to the country. I wrote to them 
and was glad to hear your dad is on the mend. 

People react to getting tenure in interesting ways. 
Most continue their teaching and research exactly as be- 
fore, but with reduced stress. (This does not apply in the 
UK, by the way, because tenure was abolished there 
twenty years ago.) But I do remember one colleague 
who earnestly declared his intention to publish no more 
than one paper every five years for the rest of his career. 
That, he said, was the frequency with which good ideas 
came to him. It was an honest attitude, but possibly not a 
wise one. Another devoted himself almost exclusively to 
consulting work; within two years he'd left the university 
to start his own company. He now has a vacation home

Letters to a Young Mathematician 

on one of the Caribbean islands. Apparently he got tired 
of "cheap and cheerful." 

You, I see, have reacted by growing philosophical. 

The physicist Ernest Rutherford used to say that 
when a young researcher in his lab started talking about 
"the universe," he put a stop to it immediately. I'm more 
relaxed about such talk than Rutherford was. My main 
reservation is that the territory should not be reserved 
solely for philosophers. 

Two and a half thousand years ago, Plato declared that 
God is a geometer. In 1939 Paul Dirac echoed this, say- 
ing, "God is a mathematician." Arthur Eddington went a 
step further and declared God to be zpure mathematician. 
It is certainly curious that so many philosophers and sci- 
entists have been convinced of a fundamental link be- 
tween God and mathematics. (Erdos, who thought God 
had other fish to fry, still believed He kept a Book of 
Proofs close at hand.) 

God and mathematics both strike terror into the 
heart of common humanity, but the connection must 
surely run deeper. This is not a question of religion. You 
needn't subscribe to a personal deity to be awestruck by 
the astonishing patterns in the universe or to observe that 
they seem to be mathematical. Every spiral snail shell or 
circular ripple on a pond shouts that message at us. 

From here it's a short step to seeing mathematics as 
the fabric of natural law and dramatizing that view by 



197 



Ian Stewart 

attributing mathematical abilities to a metaphorical or 
actual deity. But what are laws of nature? Are they deep 
truths about the world, or simplifications imposed on na- 
ture's unutterable complexity by humanity's limited 
brainpower? Is God really a geometer? Are mathematical 
patterns really present in nature, or do we invent them? 
Or, if real, are they merely a superficial aspect of nature 
that we fixate on because it's what we can comprehend? 

The reason we cannot answer these questions defini- 
tively is that we human beings cannot step outside our- 
selves to obtain an objective view of the universe. 
Everything we experience is mediated by our brains. 
Even our vivid impression that the world is "out there" 
is a wonderful trick. The nerve cells in our brains create 
a simplified copy of reality inside our heads and then 
persuade us that we live inside it, rather than the other 
way around. After hundreds of millions of years of evo- 
lution, the human brain's abilities have been selected not 
for "objectivity" but to improve its owner's chances of 
survival in a complex environment. As a result, the brain 
is not at all a passive observer of nature. Our visual sys- 
tem, for example, creates the illusion of a seamless world 
that envelops us completely, yet at any instant our brains 
are detecting only a tiny part of the visual field. 

Because we cannot experience the universe objectively, 
we sometimes see patterns that do not exist. About two 
thousand years ago, one of the strongest pieces of evi- 
dence for the existence of a geometer God was the Ptole- 



198 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

maic theory of epicycles. The motion of every planet in 
the solar system was held to be built up from an intricate 
system of revolving spheres. How much more mathemati- 
cal can you get? But appearances are deceptive, and today 
this system strikes us as nonsensical and overly complex. It 
can be adjusted to model any kind of orbit, even a square 
one. Ultimately it fails, because it cannot lead us to an ex- 
planation of why the world should be this way. 

Compare Ptolemy's wheels within wheels to Isaac 
Newton's clockwork universe, set in motion at the mo- 
ment of creation and thereafter obeying fixed and im- 
mutable mathematical rules. For example, the acceleration 
of a body is the force acting on it divided by its mass. 
This one law explains all kinds of motion, from cannon- 
balls to the cosmos. It has been refined to take relativis- 
tic and quantum effects into account in the realms of the 
very small or the enormously fast, but it unifies an enor- 
mous body of observational evidence. The tiny ripples 
discovered recently in the cosmic microwave back- 
ground show that when the big bang went off, the uni- 
verse did not explode equally in all directions. This 
asymmetry is responsible for the clumping of matter 
without which you and I wouldn't have a leg — or a 
planet — to stand on. It's an impressive verification of the 
modern extensions of Newton's laws, and it shows that 
patterns need not be perfect to be important. 

It is no coincidence that Newton's laws deal with 
forms of matter and energy that are accessible to our 



199 



Ian Stewart 

senses, such as force. If we ride on a fairground roller- 
coaster, we feel ourselves pulled off our seats as the vehi- 
cle careers over a bump. But again our brains are playing 
tricks. Our senses do not react directly to forces. In our 
ears are devices, the semicircular canals, that detect not 
force but acceleration. Our brains then run Newton's law 
in reverse to provide a sensation of force. Newton was 
"deconstructing" his sensory apparatus back into the laws 
that made it work to begin with. If Newton's laws hadn't 
worked, then his ears wouldn't have worked either. 

We have gotten much better at spotting the artificial- 
ity of putative patterns like Ptolemy's, systematic delu- 
sions created by a mathematics that is so adaptable that it 
can explain anything. One way to eliminate these delu- 
sions is to favor simplicity and elegance: Dirac's provoca- 
tive point, and the true message of Occam's razor. 

One of the simplest and most elegant sources of 
mathematical pattern in nature is symmetry. 

Symmetry is all around us. We ourselves are bilater- 
ally symmetric: we still look like people when viewed in 
a mirror. The symmetry is not perfect — normally hearts 
are on the left — but an almost-symmetry is just as strik- 
ing as an exact one, and equally in need of explanation. 
There are precisely 230 symmetry types of crystals. 
Snowflakes are hexagonally symmetric. Many viruses 
have the symmetry of a dodecahedron, a regular solid 
made from twelve pentagons. A frog begins life as a 
spherically symmetric Qgg and ends it as a bilaterally

Letters to a Young Mathematician 

symmetric adult. There are symmetries in the structure 
of the atom and the swirl of galaxies. 

Where do nature is symmetric patterns come from? 
Symmetry is the repetition of identical units. The main 
source of identical units is matter. Matter is composed of 
tiny subatomic particles, and all particles of a given type 
are identical. All electrons are exactly the same. The fa- 
mous physicist Richard Feynman once suggested that 
perhaps there is only one electron, batting backward and 
forward in time, and we observe it multiple times. Be 
that as it may, the interchangeability of electrons implies 
that potentially the universe has an enormous amount of 
symmetry. There are many ways to move the universe 
and leave it looking the same. The symmetries of a spiral 
snail shell or the drops of dew spaced along a spider's 
web at dawn can be traced back to this pattern-forming 
potential of fundamental particles. The patterns that we 
experience on a human scale are traces of deeper pat- 
terns in the structure of space-time. 

Unless, of course, those deeper symmetries are only 
imaginary, the modern version of epicycles. 

That the universe we experience is a contrivance of 
our imaginations, however, does not imply that the uni- 
verse itself has no independent existence. Imagination is 
an activity of brains, which are made from the same kind 
of materials as the rest of the cosmos. Philosophers may 
debate whether the pattern that we detect in a tiger's 
stripes is really present in an actual tiger; but the pattern 



201 



Ian Stewart 

of neural activity evoked in our brains by the tiger's 
stripes is definitely present in an actual brain. Mathe- 
matics is an activity of brains, so they at least can on oc- 
casion function according to mathematical laws. And if 
brains really can do that, why not tigers too? 

Our minds may indeed be just swirls of electrons in 
nerve cells; but those cells are part of the universe, they 
evolved within it, and they have been molded by Na- 
ture's deep love affair with symmetry. The swirls of elec- 
trons in our heads are not random, not arbitrary, and 
not — even in a godless universe, if that is what it is — an 
accident. They are patterns that have survived millions 
of years of Darwinian selection for congruence with re- 
ality. What better way to build simplified models of the 
world than to exploit simplicities that are actually there? 
Imaginary systems that get too far removed from reality 
are not useful for survival. 

Intellectual constructs like epicycles or laws of mo- 
tion may be either deep truths or clever delusions. The 
task of science is to provide a selection process for ideas 
that is just as stringent as that employed by evolution to 
weed out the unfit. Mathematics is one of its chief tools, 
because mathematics mimics the pictures in our heads 
that let us simplify the universe. But unlike those pic- 
tures, mathematical models can be transferred from one 
brain to another. Mathematics has thus become a crucial 
point of contact between different human minds; and 
with its aid, science has come down in favor of Newton 



202 



Letters to a Young Mathematician 

and against Ptolemy. Even though Newton's laws — or, 
more to the point, their modern successors, relativity 
and quantum theory — may eventually turn out to be 
delusions, they are much more productive delusions 
than Ptolemy's. 

Symmetry is a better delusion still. It is deep, elegant, 
and general. It is also a geometric concept. So the 
geometer God is really a God of symmetry. 

Perhaps we have created a geometer God in our own 
image, but we have done it by exploiting the basic sim- 
plicities that nature supplied when our brains were 
evolving. Only a mathematical universe can develop 
brains that do mathematics. Only a geometer God can 
create a mind that has the capacity to delude itself that a 
geometer God exists. 

In that sense, God is a mathematician; and She's a lot 
better at it than we are. Every so often, She lets us peek 
over her shoulder.
